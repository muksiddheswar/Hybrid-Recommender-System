1011,"Bridging the industrial heat divide",NULL,NULL,"<p>Between industrial heat owners and relevant solution providers</p>
<p>While I was running a sales team for a product that recovered heat and converted it into electricity, I would get daily inquiries from companies that had waste heat available. Each of them wanted a heat recovery solution.</p>
<p>Sounds great right? It wasn’t.</p>
<h3><strong>The problem</strong></h3>

<p>Most of the inquirers didn’t know how much heat they had or what they could do with it. This wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing, but when we ran our heat analyses, there was often too little heat or too much, the temperature was too low, the operating hours were insufficient, etc. so the inquiries weren’t a fit for our solution.</p>
<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""102"" height=""127"" src=""fileadmin/_processed_/b/1/csm_logo_knorrbremse_190x68_fdeffced4f.png"" width=""354"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>
<p>Heat recovery equipment must be somewhat specific to a quantity of heat and a temperature range. We had 1 heat recovery product line, but received inquiries to use heat from a light bulb one day to heat from a 100 MW gas turbine the day after (a gas turbine of that size supplies enough power for 100,000 US homes).</p>
<p>Although our product wasn’t a fit for most of the inquiries, almost all of the heat sources could still apply to other heat recovery technologies (yes, you can use heat from a lightbulb).</p>
<p>After speaking with other heat recovery solution providers, we realized they were doing the same thing. Industrials were spending too much time finding solutions. Solution providers were spending too much time fielding inquiries that weren’t a fit.</p>
<p>This process is analogous to someone wanting to book travel from LA to London and calling individual airlines… and auto companies, taxis, and even bicycle shops to figure out how to get from A to B. There had to be a better way.</p>

<h3><strong>The solution</strong></h3>

<p>This year, I teamed up with a colleague to remedy this knowledge gap by starting a company called HeatCalc. Our goal is simple: to enable more heat recovery projects by making it easier for industrials to find the right solutions for their heat source.</p>
<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""101"" height=""150"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Organisations/logo_kendrion_300x150.png"" width=""300"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>
<p>HeatCalc is an online hub of useful heat recovery information and will connect a heat source owner (e.g. a cement plant) to the most relevant heat recovery solution providers based on the specifics of their heat source… all for free. The site has recent heat recovery news, project examples, guides and useful tools, such as a heat calculator that will quantify the amount of heat you have at your site.</p>
<p>Industrials can also request a free consultation with a member of our heat recovery staff and we provide a free heat analysis and/or advice on how to proceed. What you do from there is up to you; we are equipment and supplier agnostic, so we are not going to try to sell you anything.</p>

<h3><strong>The opportunity</strong></h3>

<p>Heat is an abundant source of clean energy. An estimated 20-50% of all industrial energy is lost as waste heat. This includes everything from the large fiues at steel and chemical plants to the chillers and compressors that operate inside light manufacturing facilities. (<a href=""http://www.energy.gov/"" target=""_blank"">USDOE</a>)</p>
<p>From 1981 to 2015 the US Industrial Assessment Center performed 17,335 industrial assessments at companies across the US to identify energy saving opportunities. Of those, there were 6,300 heat recovery related recommendations. The most common one: recovering heat from an air compressor. The average payback for all the recommendations: 1.52 years. (<a href=""http://energy.gov/eere/amo/industrial-assessment-centers-iacs"" target=""_blank"">US IAC</a>)</p>

<p>Heat is also a very versatile form of energy. It can warm buildings, purify water, preheat combustion air, generate electricity, generate cooling, etc. The overriding theme with all of these options is that it can save businesses money and reduce carbon footprints simultaneously.</p>

1020,"How much can energy management actually save?",NULL,NULL,"<p>There’s no debate on the importance of the concept of energy management – a structured process through which organisations seek to optimise their energy use. Its definition and practice is codified through standards such as EN ISO 50001. Yet despite its overall acceptance as “the way to go”, it might come as a surprise to learn that only 1.5% of medium to large companies in Europe have adopted EN ISO 50001.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is this figure so low? One reason is that energy management has been given relatively modest attention within EU policy portfolios. Another reason is that organisations are simply unaware of the level of energy savings possible through energy management.</p>
<p>A report prepared for the <strong>European Copper Institute</strong> by Waide Strategic Efficiency Limited seeks to address both issues. It presents the results of a detailed quantified analysis of the savings potential from greater adoption of effective energy management in the EU’s industrial and service sectors.</p>
<p>The figure that Waide comes up with has to be taken extremely seriously. According to the report, adoption of energy management could lead to a reduction of European industry’s energy consumption of 26% by 2035! This equates to 1728 Mtoe of cumulative energy savings from 2015 to 2035, and corresponding CO2 emission savings of 4.8 gigatonnes. Obviously, investments are necessary to deliver these savings. These are estimated at some €91 billion of extra investments in equipment and related services between 2015 and 2035. Large as this investment is, it is over twelve times less than the value of the resulting savings in energy bills.</p>
<p>The report goes further by analysing policies that could help to increase energy management adoption rates across the EU and positions them within the context of the existing EU policy portfolio for energy efficiency. It considers where these measures fit within the broader portfolio of EU energy efficiency policy instruments and concludes with a set of policy recommendations pertinent to the ongoing reviews of the major EU Directives.</p>
<p>The report will be launched on <strong>14th June at a workshop </strong>during the E2 Energy Efficiency for Industry Conference in<strong> Brussels</strong>. Anyone seriously interested in any aspect of promoting energy management is invited to attend.</p>"
1021,"All eyes on China’s 13th Five-Year Plan for energy",NULL,NULL,"<p>China’s 13th&nbsp;Five-Year Plan for energy (Energy 13FYP) might be one of the most anticipated official documents in the world and is one that will have far-reaching impacts on the carbon trajectory of the world’s number one&nbsp;emitter. Recently, information about the plan begins to surface in the Chinese media.</p>
<p>On July 11, the Economic Information Daily, a major financial&nbsp;newspaper, reported that publication of the central government policy intently watched by the climate and energy community is “imminent”. More specifically, the report spells out key targets that are being considered by the country’s energy policymakers.</p>
<p>This blog intends to summarise the information about those targets based on publicly-available&nbsp;information. Before that, a bit of background.</p>

<h3>What’s up with all the FYPs?</h3>

<p>The first question anyone new to China’s planning cycles may ask is: What’s the nature or status of this Energy 13FYP? Our readers may remember that in March, China unveiled its 13th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development (2016-2020), which contains a set of <a href=""https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/8734-Climate-energy-and-China-s-13th-Five-Year-Plan-in-graphics"" target=""_blank"">climate and energy related targets</a>, including an energy consumption cap and a 15% goal for the share of non&nbsp;fossil-based energy in the country’s primary energy mix. If we consider this the “Master Plan” for all aspects of China’s development in the next five year period, the Energy 13FYP is a specification of that Master Plan for the energy sector, with more detailed targets that will better guide policy making, government spending and project planning in the sector.<br /> <br /> The chart below illustrates the hierarchy of Chinese plan making, which locates the Energy 13FYP as a “Special Plan” for a specific sector. Special planning follows the completion of national general plans, and its process is less predictable. It is noteworthy that for the 12th Five Year Plan cycle (2011-2015), the Energy plan <a href=""http://greenleapforward.com/2013/01/31/calvin-quek-chinas-energy-plan-on-pm2-5-and-water-energy-nexus-is-significant-new-thinking/"" target=""_blank"">took almost two years</a> to make and was only released in 2013. Therefore, even if media declare the Energy 13FYP “imminent”, there is no guarantee when exactly it will be published.</p>

<h3>What can we expect from the Energy 13FYP?</h3>

<p>The chart below illustrates the numerous 2020 targets already declared by the Chinese government through its Strategic Energy Action Plan (2014-2020) and its national 13th Five Year Plan. They are set against actual levels at the end of 2015 as a benchmark. The comparison serves as a basis to gauge if the Energy 13FYP is sufficiently ambitious to meet China’s domestic and international commitments.</p>
<p>It should be noted that what is currently known about the targets in the Energy 13FYP is based on media reports and publicly available information. It is subject to change depending on ongoing internal consultation and negotiations among policy makers.</p>

<h3>Between the lines</h3>
<p>Media reports about the Energy 13FYP also reveal deeply rooted concerns that have troubled Chinese policymakers:</p>
<ol> 	<li>Overcapacity: China’s power sector is faced with a severe overcapacity problem. Slowing demand for electricity due to the economic downturn and slashing of energy intensive industries has caused widespread under-utilisation of existing power generation capacities, which are seeing their lowest utilisation hours since 1978. Yet the country is still seeing <a href=""https://next.ft.com/content/565a872a-480e-11e6-8d68-72e9211e86ab"" target=""_blank"">fast build-up of coal-fired power capacities</a> as a result of inertia (many projects were approved in the heyday of the economic boom) and perverse&nbsp;incentives (dropping coal price and a government fixed electricity tariff is increasing&nbsp;the profit margin for coal power). The worsening overcapacity situation has prompted regulators to consider putting <a href=""http://news.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2016-07/11/c_129133666.htm"" target=""_blank"">a two-year “freeze period”</a> in the Energy 13FYP for the approval of any new coal-fired power projects.<br /> 	&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Curtailment: The other side of the overcapacity coin is <a href=""https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/8965-Blowing-in-the-wind"" target=""_blank"">curtailment of renewable energy</a>, particularly wind and solar energy in western parts of the country. A combination of transmission bottlenecks and market set-up has blocked large chunks of renewable electricity from reaching the grid. In 2015, 15% of China’s wind energy was wasted, a historical high. Based on what’s written about the Energy 13FYP, the problem seems to have pressed policy makers to put more emphasis on reining in curtailment, at least for the first half of the 13th Five Year cycle, as opposed to further expansion of installed capacity. Whether this will become a factor that contributes to lower-than-expected wind and solar targets remains to be seen.</li> </ol>

<p>That is very much the same what we, the industry network EEIP, got as a market feedback. And it came with a request to us. As the biggest global industry network focussing on products, services, IT, financing and policies in the industrial energy efficiency market - we should be able to find a smart solution allowing companies to benefit from the network: <strong>to grow their business and to finally grow the market.</strong></p>
<p>And it should be a solution perfectly fitting the needs of SMEs!</p>

1027,"Heatpumps - an overlooked opportunity?",NULL,NULL,"<h3><strong>Recover energy, don’t waste it! </strong></h3>
<h4>What do a Norwegian fjord, a Belgian brewery, a Danish dairy plant, a Finnish data center, a German office building, and a French sports center (and many more) have in common? They use heat pumps – and nobody knows.</h4>

<p>Heat pump technology is well known for the provision of heating, cooling and hot water to <strong>residential buildings</strong> in an efficient and reliable manner. Less known are the larger cousins of residential heat pumps –<strong>industrial and commercial units</strong>. While they also provide the same primary services, they add an important factor to energy systems in cities, large buildings or industrial processes: Large heat pumps close energy loops.</p>
<p>Wherever humans are active, they require energy. Energy always “flows” from a higher to a lower temperature level. The result is a surplus of energy at a level usually deemed not useful. In a typical <strong>residential building</strong>, the users need heating and cooling, lightning, entertainment etc. and while the inhabitants enjoy these services, energy is eventually lost. The same holds true for <strong>commercial buildings, hospitals, schools.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Heat pumps can provide energy, but they can also help reduce the absolute energy demand by being integrated into heat recovery systems. In larger buildings, a smart, heat pump based energy management can distribute energy between parts of the building requiring heating and those in need for cooling. This could also be done between different buildings.</p>
<p>The effect is even bigger in <strong>industry</strong>. Apart from the need to heat/cool buildings and to provide hot water for kitchen and showers, many industrial processes today run at temperatures below 100°C. This makes them suitable for the use of heat pumps. Prototypes can even provide temperatures up to 170°C. An evaluation of the technical potential of heat pumps in industrial applications revealed an energy savings potential of 174TWh or about 10% of industry heating energy demand. The savings amount is even larger, when considering the integration of cooling and refrigeration processes into the system.</p>
<table> 	<tbody> 		<tr> 			<td><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""84"" height=""188"" src=""fileadmin/_processed_/4/d/csm_logo_ziehl_206x38_df9be9085d.png"" width=""1020"" style="""" /></td> 		</tr> 	</tbody> </table>


<h3><strong>Connecting the dots is a key challenge to fully use the potential. </strong></h3>
<p>Energy flows in industry are often complex. They <strong>require and provide energy at different times, locations and temperature levels as well as in in different quantities. </strong></p>
<p>Every <strong>energy input</strong> results in waste energy at a lower level, every <strong>cooling/refrigeration processes produces waste heat</strong> and even if a heat pump is used for &nbsp;heating, it results in waste cooling. <strong>This energy can either be discarded to the environment or recovered to improve overall energy efficiency. </strong></p>
<p>People need to understand this process to decide favourably for its imolementation. Experts responsible for designing and operating industrial processes also may not know about the opportunities. A typical comment of a plant manager was: “a by-product of our main process is energy at 50°C but it is useless to us. Even worse, it becomes a cost factor, as we have to invest in installations to get rid of it”.</p>
<p>The challenge is to connect application areas and to find a use for waste heat from a cooling process or for waste cold from a heating process is the challenge. Sometimes it may just need some creative thinking, sometimes it can only be achieved by re-designing the whole production process. If successful, efficiency improvements are tremendous. Up to an extend that the beneficiaries of these improvements do not want others to know; preferring to reaping the cost advantage for as long as possible.</p>
<h3><strong>Heat pumps are becoming state-of-the art in commercial applications</strong></h3>
<p>Office buildings, hotels, restaurants, hospitals, and sports facilities all need heating and cooling – quite often they require more heating than cooling. Most of them also need hot water for different purposes. Installing a heat pump as stand-alone solution or in a hybrid configuration is more and more common. Using only one machine to provide heating and cooling is economically even more efficient</p>
<h3><strong>Industrial Processes</strong></h3>
<p>Heat pumps can be applied in many industrial production processes. Application areas include:</p>
<ul> 	<li><strong>Heating / cooling of buildings</strong></li> 	<li><strong>Cleaning</strong></li> 	<li><strong>D</strong><strong>rying</strong> – usually energy loops are closed by connecting the waste energy side to the source energy side and bridging the difference in temperature via the heat pump. If necessary, a fossil burner is added as back up energy source or to cover peak demand.</li> 	<li><strong>F</strong><strong>ood production and processing</strong> (flakes, brewing, malting, fruit and vegetables, yeast noodles, potato as well as meat, milk and cheese),</li> 	<li><strong>G</strong><strong>eneral production </strong>(such as textiles, timber industries, rubber and plastics, paper, brewing, malting brick production, and metal coating).</li> </ul>

<p>Connecting energy loops by using the waste energy from one process, shifting it to a useful level and providing it to another process is the wholy grail of efficient process design.</p>
<p>The following examples give insights into realized advantages of large heat pump installations in diverse application areas for office buildings, district heating, paper mill, hotles and dairy production. They can only be an inventive to consider heat pump applications further. To fully unleash this potential, it will not only require the industry to develop the technology even further, but also political clout, Policy makers need to create frameworks and markets that favor heat pump based systems as most sustainable solutions. They should favor energy demand reductuon using recovered energy in a similar manner as they favor the use of renewable energy today.</p>
<p>Last but not least, fixing the current market mechanism is the elephant in the room. Payback times of heat pumps that are acceptable to industry as well as availability of financing options depends largely on the comparison with cost of fossil fuel alternatives. If policy makers want to use the market mechanism for the energy transition, they need to set a correctice price signal.</p>
<p>Heads of states and governments have signed the COP21 agreements in limiting global warming to significantly below 2 degrees Celsius last december in Paris.</p>
<p>Making full use of the potential of large heat pumps in residential and commercial buildings, industrial processes and cities will make achieving this target much easier.But even more than that: a decarbonisation of the energy system is impossible without decarbonisation of the heating sector; a decarbonisation of the heating and cooling sector is impossible without heat pumps.</p>

<h3><strong>Background : Heat pump technology </strong></h3>
<p>Heat pumps convert air, ground heat and water into energy – it’s that simple! The general principle of the technology is identical and independent of application. A heat pump can provide heating, cooling and sanitary hot water for residential, commercial and industrial applications. Heat pumps transform energy from <strong>renewable energy sources</strong> (air | aerothermal, ground | geothermal and water | hydrothermal) into useful heat. They can also use <strong>recovered energy</strong> from industrial processes, infrastructure installations (sewers, subway, underground parking) or exhaust air from buildings. The transformation is done via the <strong>refrigeration cycle</strong>. It consists of a heat source, the heat pump unit and a distribution system to heat/cool the building, usually either air ducts or water pipes.</p>
<p>While a number of technical variations for heat pump technology exist, the electric compression cycle is most commonly used. In an electric compression heat pump a transfer fluid (refrigerant) transports the heat from a low energy source to a higher energy sink. Auxiliary energy - usually electricity or gas - is needed to run the compressor and the heat pumps.</p>
<h3><strong>The refrigerant cycle provides heating and cooling, continuously</strong></h3>

<p>Heat pump systems are optimized for heating or cooling. In heating mode, ambient energy is the heat source and the building/process is the heat sink. In cooling mode, the building/process is cooled down using the outside as the heat sink. Obviously, a system’s efficiency increases greatly in application areas with a parallel demand for heating and cooling giving such systems an additional economic advantage.</p>
<p>Positive side effects heat pump use are local employment, reducing import dependency, making energy cost more stable and predictable, and bridging the electric and thermal sectors by providing demand response potential and stabilizing the electric grid.</p>
<p>Heat pumps are cross-cutting the modern, future-oriented energy system. The required decarbonization of the energy system cannot be achieved without decarbonizing the heating sector. The heating sector cannot be decarbonized without heat pumps!</p>

This would lead to more than one million additional jobs.</p>
<p>Increasing the size of the emerging EU energy renovation market would require the design of an overarching, integrated and streamlined framework for buildings based on the ""Efficiency First"" principle. Such an overarching framework would, as required by the better regulation package, streamline reporting and ensure coherence between the <strong>investment-climate-energy provisions currently included in at least 14 EU policy instruments</strong>. It would also simplify implementation for Member States, avoid double-counting and facilitate compliance checking. The first step towards this transformation is to address the gaps and loopholes identified in the 14 existing EU instruments aiming to increase investments in reducing energy consumption in buildings and their related GHG emissions. The report suggests a specific recommendation for each of the identified gaps and loopholes.</p>
<p>The <strong>""Efficiency First"" investment-climate-energy proposed framework for buildings</strong> would require new governance structure at EU level including setting-up an <strong>EU Energy Renovation Facilitator and an EU Risk Sharing Facility</strong>.

1029,"Industrial heat: An emission free energy source",NULL,NULL,"<p>Heat is a form of energy that is all around us. There’s heat from the</p>
<p>sun (solar thermal), and from the earth (geothermal), but for this post,</p>
<p>I want to talk about industrial heat - heat that is a byproduct of</p>
<p>manufacturing, re?ning, smelting, generating electricity, etc. - and its</p>
<p>many bene?cial uses.</p>
<h3><strong>There’s a lot of industrial heat</strong></h3>

<p>20-50% of the energy consumed by US industry is ultimately lost as heat,</p>
<p>which equals 5&nbsp; to 13 quadrillion BTU per year of unused energy (US</p>
<p>DOE). For perspective, that’s somewhere between the entire energy</p>
<p>consumption of Turkey and Germany (EIA).<br /> <br /> I’d like to note that</p>
<p>this is not an indication of unusual waste at the facilities, but more</p>
<p>an indication of the large size of US industry. Other countries would</p>
<p>likely have similar ratios of heat available.<br /> <br /> While some waste</p>
<p>heat losses are inevitable and unavoidable, many facilities around the</p>
<p>world can increase their overall ef?ciency and bottom lines by</p>
<p>installing waste heat recovery technologies.</p>

<h3><strong>Heat utilization options</strong></h3>
<p>Waste heat comes in many forms, including exhaust heat, hot air,</p>
<p>water and steam. Once the heat is recovered or captured, typically with a</p>
<p>heat exchanger, there are 3 primary options for putting it to more</p>
<p>ef?cient use:</p>
<ul> 	<li>For heating (e.g. fuel pre-heating, space heating, water heating, etc.)</li> 	<li>For cooling (e.g. air conditioning or refrigeration with absorption chillers)</li> 	<li>For generating electricity (e.g. rankine cycle, thermoelectrics, etc.)</li> </ul>

<h3><strong>Economic and environmental benefits</strong></h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>All of the options above represent emission&nbsp; free substitutes for</p>
<p>costly purchased fuels or electricity. Accordingly, heat utilization can</p>
<p>reduce the operating costs, potentially the capital costs (by</p>
<p>displacing boilers or chillers), and carbon footprint of a business</p>
<p>simultaneously.<br /> <br /> The World Bank commissioned a study on waste heat</p>
<p>recovery in the cement industry and found the that deploying waste heat</p>
<p>recovery had signi?cant environmental and economic bene?ts for the</p>
<p>cement plants.<br /> <br /> <em>“Waste Heat Recovery can reduce the operating costs and improve EBITDA margins of cement factories by about 10 to 15 percent.”</em> - International Finance Corporation (IFC)</p>

<h3><strong>Projects</strong></h3>

<p>So why aren’t more heat utilization projects occurring? Many are. There</p>
<p>are CHP (combined heat and power) projects delivering electricity and</p>
<p>heat to hospitals, campuses, and industrial facilities. Absorption</p>
<p>chillers use waste heat to provide cooling at warehouses, malls and food</p>
<p>storage facilities. Heat to power projects generate electricity at</p>
<p>cement plants and small wood stoves charge cell phones in remote</p>
<p>villages.<br /> But with all that heat energy available, there could be</p>
<p>more. One of the barriers to enabling projects is access to information</p>
<p>and immediate feedback on individual heat sources. Industrial heat comes</p>
<p>from an array of sources (engines, boilers, kilns, furnaces, turbines,</p>
<p>?ares, incinerators, ovens, etc.) and each source has a different heat</p>
<p>makeup, which affects what you can do with it.</p>

<h3><strong>Overcoming project barriers </strong></h3>

<p>One of the ?rst steps in initiating a heat recovery project is</p>
<p>understanding the quality and quantity of heat available. Estimating the</p>
<p>quantity of heat in your heat source used to be a bit like estimating</p>
<p>solar output on a home’s roof: it required getting in touch with a solar</p>
<p>manufacturer or an engineer in the industry to crunch the numbers.</p>
<p>Today, you can plug your address into a site like NREL’s and get an</p>
<p>instant solar output estimate (<a href=""http://www.nrel.gov/"" target=""_blank"">NREL</a>).<br /> <br /> At</p>
<p>HeatCalc, we are doing for waste heat what the solar industry has done</p>
<p>for calculating home solar output: automating estimates, maximizing</p>
<p>knowledge sharing, and streamlining connections to the most relevant</p>
<p>solution providers. Anyone that has a heat source - from air compressors</p>
<p>to large kilns and exhaust stacks can get feedback on their heat source</p>
<p>for free and discover ways they can utilize their heat that save time</p>
<p>and money. Most importantly, based on your unique heat source we can</p>
<p>connect you to the most relevant solution providers, saving you time and</p>
<p>money in the process.<br /> <br /> Our goal is to enable more waste heat utilization projects, which make the most out of the energy we are already consuming.</p>

1031,"Energy efficiency works!",NULL,NULL,"<p>In their annual report the German Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control (BAFA; ger.) published the results of their work in 2015. Known for the „Energiewende“, Germany works with the incentive principle to motivate German companys to invest in energy efficiency by supporting their replacement investments of generic technologies (Querschnittstechnologien) through promotions.</p>
<p>In 2015 there has been investments related to energy efficiency funding in generic technologies such as electrical motors and drives, industrial pumps, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, compressed air systems, systems for heat and waste heat recovery, LED technology (limited in 2015) of more than 250 mil. euro. The Federal Office supported this by paying out 59,22 mil. euro. The final energy saving of these generic systems in 2015 is 494.000.000 kWh (494 GWh) per year. In turn these save 296.400 tons of CO2 or 6 mil square meters of forest ( about 1.100 US football fields ). That's the outcome! But how we came to this? About what is needed to make energy efficiency work we spoke with Bernd Hesse, audited energy manager at wattline GmbH, one of the biggest energy service providers in Germany.</p>
<h3><strong>The numbers are remarkable, what is the contribution of wattline in this process?</strong></h3>
<p>B: The challenge for us at wattline is to make energy efficiency happen for real. It takes months of preparations and staying power during the process until the new technology is in place and the pay ou oft he federal office for economy arrives in the account oft he customer. Our role is the critical interface between theory and practice. It can only be successful if you stay focused like we do in our energy efficiency team.</p>
<h3><strong>So you have a special process you guide the customers through?&nbsp;Can you describe this system in short?</strong></h3>
<p>B: We do. The project management team developed the wattline EnergyEfficiencyConcept (EEK; ger.) in 2012 and 2013 and since then we supported already more than 850 companies that benefit from our circulation.</p>
<p>A circulation of seven steps is the framework of the EnergyEfficiencyConcept and our team leads the customer through it. We start with the contract, we help organize the funding of a independent certified energy consultant that creates a report the energy status quo, we do the analysis of the report, discuss the options with our customers, organize technology offers from the industry, help to get the funding for the technology and accompany our customer until the targeted analysis. To give an example 10% of all BAFA funded energy consultings in Germany in 2015 came through wattline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thank you. It is good to be a part of the German Energiewende sucess. We initially met on Twitter and we share enthusiasm for the potential of social media for industrial energy efficiency.

1032,"Securing Energy Efficiency to Secure the Energy Union",NULL,NULL,"<h3><strong>How Energy Efficiency meets the EU Climate and Energy Goals</strong></h3>
<p>The JRC report (download link above) provides scientific evidence to support the “Efficiency First” principle considered by the Energy Union strategy. Based on the analysis of the decarbonisation scenarios &nbsp;the report shows that energy saving will be in 2030 as the first fuel of Europe (Figure 1). Moreover, in the scenario targeting 40% energy saving, the sum of energy saving and renewables will overtake the sum of all fossil fuels (solid fuels, oil and gaz). As a result, energy dependency and climate change are mitigated and fossil fuel import bills are lowered while, currently, fossil fuel imports worsen most Member States’ trade balances and increase their contribution to global warming. In sum, by making energy efficiency the mechanism for delivering moderation of demand, the EU will meet its objectives in terms of security of supply, climate change while driving growth, boosting the competitiveness of the EU industry and creating jobs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the decarbonisation of the EU energy system requires a paradigm shift in the design of climate and energy policies to make energy saving the niche fuel for investors, especially when energy prices are low and in the absence of a global agreement to price carbon saving. Closing the 2020 energy efficiency gap is the first step towards meeting the 2030 target. Achieving this objective requires scaling-up private investment in energy efficiency projects, reshaping institutions and skills as well as investing in the development and the deployment of low-carbon technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scale of the investment needs to decarbonise the EU energy system calls for the development of framework for De-risking Energy Efficiency Investment (DEEI). The aim is to ensure that energy saving compete on equal terms with generation capacity by lowering the perceived risk by investors which increases the financial cost and consequently the capital-cost of the decarbonisation of the EU energy system. A guarantee fund for such investments is recommended. It would reduce financial cost by providing a guarantee for energy efficiency loans, thus lowering the interest rate and consequently the capital cost. Furthermore, given the common agreement to consider climate change and energy security as societal issues which are both mitigated by energy efficiency, a societal discount rate should be used when conducting costs/benefits analysis of the decarbonisation of the EU energy system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The better regulation strategy and the upcoming revision of various EU climate and energy policy instruments offer a great opportunity for the development of streamlined and a more integrated climate and energy policy framework that should include the DEEI as one of its component.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s hope 2016 will be a turning point for the EU climate and energy policies and make sure we will not miss our last chance to secure the Energy Union!</p>"

<p>That said, the main lever for companies to get a good return from their pump investment is to maximise the efficiency of an installed pump in any way. And this means to minimize the energy consumption as well as to maximise the availability of the pump – or in other words ""<strong>energy efficiency</strong>"" and ""<strong>maintenance</strong>"".</p>
<p>As this turns out to be a complex subject with the risk of ending up with a 256 pages paper, I am trying to give some insights using a ""pumps post series"".</p>
<p>This post will give a little overview of what is meant by the two building blocks ""energy efficiency"" and ""maintenance"". This will then be discussed in more depth in 2 following posts. Finally I want to conclude this series with new opportunities arising from industry4.0 or IoT developments.</p>
<p>According to many experts the best approach to deal with the energy efficiency improvement is to split the subject into <strong>3 steps</strong> following the life time of a pump system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another approach is e.g. proposed by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) who propose ""<a href=""http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/14-energy-efficiency-improvement-opportunities-in-pumping-systems#index"" target=""_blank""><strong>14 energy efficiency improvement opportunities in pumping systems</strong></a>"".</p>
<p><strong>However, I will cluster it broadly into ""energy efficiency""and ""maintenance"".</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Energy Efficiency</strong></h3>
<ul> 	<li> 	<p><strong>Pumps selection</strong></p> 	<p>Which remains a delicate task to some extent because pumps should be energy efficient while reaching the objectives related to productivity. To do so physical constraints (fluid properties, temperature, pressure,...) should be taken into account</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong>System requirements</strong></p> 	<p>Considering the entire pump system. It need to be efficient enough to fit well with peak demand, average demand or potential process changes. <a href=""http://www.energypages.org/company/CompanyPage/show/cp-pump-systems/file/114_Smart_Engineering_of_Pump_Systems_in_chemcial_processes"" target=""_blank"">A good example of the benefits by adressing system requirements instead of looking at a pump in isolation is provided by this presentation from CP Pumps.</a></p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong>Initial pump design</strong></p> 	<p>Pumps are often initially oversized in order to fit peak loads or to leave an error margin for design purposes. In addition, designers sometimes tend to oversize pump for fear of being made responsible for any performance below the one initially estimated. Over sizing pumps is not bad in itself but when the pump is running under peaks load conditions while being in a normal load, there is not only unnecessary wear on components but also wasted energy . This results in operation and maintenance costs that could be avoided.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong>Increase of pump capacity</strong>&nbsp;</p> 	<p>Sometimes to respond to a growing demand pumps with higher capacity are required. Pumps initially oversized might be suitable in energy and cost efficient way. Hence there is interest to oversized pump when designing. If this is not the case any pump should be upgraded (to add a branch system) and even in some cases be completely replaced for energy savings purposes.</p> 	</li> </ul>
<h3><strong>Maintenance</strong></h3>
<p>Although it may have shortcomings in the initial choice of pumps, pumps also have shortcomings which are mainly related to their operation. I mean problems such as cavitation, wear on mechanical components and so on ... that contribute to the degradation of the performance of pumps. Some of its problems are unavoidable and the only thing to do is to reduce their effect in order to be as close to the best efficiency point (BEP) as possible over the lifetime.</p>
<p>This <strong>degradation in some cases could be significant from 10 to 25 percent over the lifetime of pump</strong> and is not only due to the age of pumps system but also due to mismatch between the pump capacity and its operation and change in process. Keeping pumps in their maximum efficiency (BEP) is a kind of process for which the starting point is the pump selection combined with the way problems (related to the operation) and demand respond will be handled.</p>

1034,"More evidence of problems with EU Emissions Trading System",NULL,NULL,"<p><em>There are concerns in the UK that Tata Steel could close its operations, leading to severe job cuts and economic disruption. Looking at the company from another angle, Arthur Neslen writes in The Guardian about how the company has benefited from more than £700m in free carbon allowances and offsets, according to analysis of emissions trading scheme data. This is not a story simply about Tata Steel. Read the article and see how many others have benefited.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Tata Steel benefited from EU climate policies, studies show</strong></h3>
<p>No other British company has benefited from the EU’s emissions trading scheme as much as Tata Steel, according to a recent report by consultants CTDelft. And it’s not alone — only firms in one country, Germany, received more than the €3bn pocketed by British businesses through the ETS between 2008 and 2014.</p>
<p>Yet Tata Steel’s chairman, Theo Henrar, argued that the ETS put its Port Talbot steelworks at “a competitive disadvantage”, because foreign rivals were not burdened by such tough environmental rules.</p>
<p>Enraged environmentalists have countered with studies by independent consultancies and market analysts showing that since 2008, Tata has taken more than £700m from the ETS in free allowances, offsets and windfall profits passed through to consumers.</p>
<p>Before the Paris climate agreement put all countries on notice to lower their emissions, the argument for “carbon leakage” measures – compensation to stop companies relocating their businesses elsewhere in the world because of Europe’s climate policies — appeared robust. The notion that cleaner European steel manufacturers could be forced to migrate to compete appeared commonsensical.</p>
<p>But one problem the European commission faced in supporting compensation was a lack of evidence that such leakage had ever occurred, according to its own studies. An OECD report last month was the latest to conclude that “tougher environmental laws do not hurt export competitiveness”.</p>
<p>In practice, the glut of free carbon allowances under the ETS – which cost the UK £13bn in lost revenues – has worked less as a trade protection, and more as an undeclared subsidy, or tax break. But labour costs in the UK are around 20 times higher than in China and, despite the handouts under the ETS, cheap Chinese steel imports to Britain more than doubled in 2014. Research suggests that subsidies for polluters were, for the most part, not spent on innovation or research.</p>
<p>Sharan Burrow, the secretary general of the International Trades Union Confederation and a New Climate Energy commissioner, complained that the handouts also depleted funds that could have enabled a more just energy transition. “Companies must accept [that] industrial transformation is essential to stabilise the planet and stop demanding a free ride,” she said. “Saving billions of dollars that can be used to support a just transition for workers in fossil fuels and invest in renewal for vulnerable communities is worth doing.”</p>
<p>Safeguards for such communities in places like Port Talbot were not high on the agenda of the EU institutions – or environmentalists – when the carbon leakage debate raged in Brussels. But they will probably heave into view again, as the proposed Port Talbot buyout by Sanjeev Gupta’s Liberty Group is examined.</p>
<p>Gupta reportedly wants to replace the blast oxygen furnace used at Port Talbot with an electric arc furnace. Arc furnaces are secondary steel plants. They recycle scrap steel that has already been made – and use electricity rather than coal or gas to power their production process. Industry sources say that these plants – which make up around 40% of Europe’s capacity – typically produce nearly five times less CO2 than blast furnaces.</p>
<p>If Gupta’s plans to power an arc furnace in Port Talbot with renewable energy are realised, its greenhouse gas emissions could be greatly reduced. The Carbon Commentary blog estimates that a switch from blast to electric arc furnaces would save over three tonnes of CO2 for each tonne of steel.</p>
<p>For steelworkers, though, this would be a mixed blessing, as arc furnaces employ far fewer people. Profits might be increased by the scything of pensions payments, but communities would also be devastated by mass layoffs. And that brings us back to the “just transition” question of who will pay for the low-carbon-energy revolution.</p>
<p>The closure of Britain’s mining industry may have been a defining moment for “green conservatism”, albeit at a terrible human cost. But the question, when the markets-first model is being extended to steel, is why employers should be shielded from its logic when their workers are not.</p>"
1035,"Smart Metering : Is it really interesting for Industry?",NULL,NULL,"<h3><strong>What is Smart Metering ?</strong></h3>
<p>About &nbsp;the issue of rational use of energy, smart metering turns out to be a real solution to consider. But, what is actually smart metering? The smart metering is literally the act of using a smart meter. This leads to question what is a smart meter? Smart meter is a tool used for recording different metering data, remote reading thereof at specified intervals and remote controlling functions associated with the electric, gaz or water meter. This tool includes so-called ""smart"" meaning capable of above functions using suitable hardware and software and performing a reliable exchange of informations, instructions and data management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The smart metering is most often referenced in the context of electric power consumption. Let us focus on electricity.</p>
<h3><strong>Current Situation in the European Union (EU)</strong></h3>
<p>80% of smart meters roll out in Europe by 2020 is the goal the European Parliament set out in 2009 in its <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1439219320638&amp;uri=CELEX:32009L0072"" target=""_blank"">Directive on common rules for the internal market in electricity</a>. The application of the Directive was conditioned by a long-term economic evaluation of all costs and benefits for the market and for the consumer, considered individually, or a study determining which model of smart meters is the most economically rational and cheaper and what timetable can be considered for distribution. What about today? According to the <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/markets-and-consumers/smart-grids-and-meters"" target=""_blank"">2014&nbsp;report of the European commission</a>, nearly 45 million smart meters have been installed in three Member States (Finland, Italy and Sweden) i.e 23 percent of installations foreseen in the EU by 2020. In the same report the commitment of Member States corresponds to an investment estimated at nearly 45 billion euros for setting up by 2020 of nearly 200 million smart electric meters (representing approximately 72 percent of European consumers) and 45 million gas meters (nearly 40 percent of consumers).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let us look a little bit at industrial applications. How can we assess the contribution of smart metering in strongly energy dependent industry ? Notice that the industrial market (in EU-28) represents slightly more than 36 percent of the energy consumption in 2013 [electricity, <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=ten00094&amp;language=en"" target=""_blank"">Eurostat 2014</a>]. Therefore, smart metering represents as well a technological as an economic approach allowing to</p>
<p><strong>1. reduce costs (economic)</strong></p>
<ul> 	<li>related to consumption due to real-time monitoring of <strong>power consumption</strong>.</li> 	<li>Additionally, it allows to optimize the entire chain of the industrial process. Indeed the use of the huge amount of data recorded by smart meters allows to adopt strategies allowding to benefit from utilities dynamic pricing policies.&nbsp;Choosing smart meters would allow industrial consumers to make significant savings by shifting their consumption <strong>away from peak hours</strong> to which the energy price is higher.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>2. reduce risk</strong> <strong>(technological)</strong></p>
<ul> 	<li>Another interesting aspect that characterizes the smart metering is the <strong>power quality</strong> (PQ) analysis and the subsequent real-time reporting PQ events enabling timely (or preventive) actions. Power quality is an electrical property which describes electrical power driving an electrical load and its ability to operate properly thanks to that electrical power. Knowing this, we can imagine how badly the productivity of manufacturers could be affected in case of PQ events in the grid supplying industry parks where those manufacturers are located. Therefore PQ Event may prove to be very critical. Hence, monitoring of smart metering systems allows to adopt solutions that can be significant for the industry at various scales that range from predicting consumption costs (time scale) to the identification of anomalies throughout an industrial process.</li> </ul>
<h3><strong>What about the actual energy efficiency ?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Use in a Refrigeration System</strong></p>
<p>A study published in the Elsevier Journal in 2014 on predicting of a refrigeration system performance used to assess the <strong>smart metering from the perspective of energy efficiency</strong>. The objective was to predict the coefficient of performance of a refrigeration system (cooling) according to the amount of refrigerant fluid - in this case R404A - flowing through the circuit by using data mining techniques applied to data provided by the smart meter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, the refrigeration system is used to extract heat from a medium to the outside. It is characterized by a refrigerant fluid which flows in the channels of the system and absorbs heat to form steam at low pressure. Then the fluid is compressed at a &nbsp;pressure high enough to transfer its heat to the ambient air or water to be condensed and form liquid. Hence, the <strong>coefficient of performance</strong>&nbsp;can be defined as the ratio of the heat removed by the refrigeration system to the heat absorbed by the system. It is a way to express the energy efficiency.&nbsp;To perform the study, the informations required have been provided by the smart metering system coupled to compressor when operating because of electrical properties related to the refrigerant fluid and &nbsp;the amount used in vapor compression in the refrigeration system.</p>
<p>The study had a kind of dual purpose. Firstly, it allowed to estimate the coefficient of performance associated with a quantity of the coolant (refrigeration fluid) and therefore the amount of coolant that affects equipments performance. &nbsp;Those equipments are assessed by their ability of cooling and the cooling time they needed. Secondly, the purpose was to detect and fix possible anomalies (leakage of refrigerent fluid) in the refrigeration system. &nbsp;Although outcomes are very encouraging (positive), it appeared interesting to pursue studies on optimization parameter in predicting coefficient of performance.</p>
<p><strong>To conclude</strong></p>
<p>Considering the application fields addressed above smart meters are useful for better controlling power consumption as well as the resulting costs. Additionally, at a certain level they can also play key role in the maintenance and optimization tasks performed in industry.</p>
<p>Besides this, the next question appeares on the wall. Will smart meters be the ""<strong>bridging technology</strong>"" towards what is often called ""<strong>industry4.0</strong>"", ""<strong>digital factory</strong>"" or just ""<strong>IoT""</strong>?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>"
1036,"Energy Efficiency At The Tipping Point?",NULL,NULL,"<p><strong>We seem to be in the middle of a Cinderella story.</strong> Energy efficiency has always been the poor relation in energy policy. It was often dismissed as not ""serious"" because one had to depend on the action of millions of consumers, one had to contend with poor data for policy and programme feedback and one had to contend with goals but no certainty in achievements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The energy efficiency community has argued for year, no decades, about the achievements and the wider reasons why our economies need energy efficiency. No doubt there has been much progress but there has always been this lingering doubt.</p>
<p>Last year, however,</p>
<ul> 	<li>we had a major global climate change agreement in Paris and everyone looking at every mitigation option. Well, not surprisingly, energy efficiency was given more attention.</li> 	<li>Earlier, G20 heads of government met and endorsed the progress made by the energy efficiency action plan that had only been approved the year before.</li> 	<li>We get the Energy Union announced in Brussels and the commissioners have come out with the expression ""energy efficiency first.""</li> 	<li>In December, we had the new executive director of the International Energy Agency come out calling for his agency to become ""... the central bank of energy efficiency... where we can transform the energy efficiency policies and give (them) to the other countries.""&nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p>Recently, we have seen the Commission consider more ambitious energy efficiency scenarios to see whether a more ambitious target is possible. We have the Commission, following public consultation, preparing a new energy efficiency package that will propose recommended changes to its flagship directives on energy efficiency. And there is a greater effort both within Europe and globally (in part through G20 and UNEP Financial Initiative) to seriously tackle the problems of adequate financing. Remember that EEIP facilitated an event last year at EU Sustainable Energy Week, to address these financing concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it is not just in Europe. We are seeing the Obama Administration even side-stepping the Supreme Court to build the momentum for greater energy efficiency. This year, the G20 is chaired by China and there is every indication that it is giving energy efficiency the priority it deservies. If you add up all these commitments and ""good words"", they make a powerful statement. They are starting to give some long-term signals that should help.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Now, what do you we need to ensure that energy efficiency really has reached the tipping point?</strong></h3>
<p>There are four actions that would get the ball rolling for the industrial sector.</p>
<ol> 	<li>First, for both energy-intensive and less energy-intensive companies, we need <strong>better benchmarking</strong> to know how companies are really improving. This means that we need to see more attention paid to collecting good, robust data, on an equivalent basis as we see for the energy supply sectors.</li> 	<li>Second, we need further support - and not always financial - to<strong> improve awareness</strong> of energy efficiency opportunities. This includes greater help in ensuring all companies implement good energy management systems.</li> 	<li>Third, we need a <strong>new generation of technical skills and knowledge</strong> at the university level where the emphasis is on improving energy performance.</li> 	<li>Fourth, we need governments to ensure there are <strong>long-term policy signals</strong> to give industry the confidence to invest in the infrastructure of the future.</li> </ol>
<p>Once we see such a commitment, then we will definitely know we have reached the tipping point.</p>"
1037,"Industrial Demand Response - too complex?",NULL,NULL,"<h3><strong>Demand Response - the next gold rush for industry? </strong></h3>
<p>It is often said the energy efficiency is a key (or even THE) driver for Demand Response.</p>
<p>Well, for utilities and grid operators it is clearly a smart way of peak shaving and/or dealing with more volatile energy sources (renewables) - which finally means less costs.<strong> But what does that mean for industry?`, can it help to reduce costs by using less energy (the energy efficiency approach) or maybe even add revenue?</strong></p>
<p>The following is my first post on Demand Response and mainly intended to set the scene. <strong>On top level, Demand Response looks great. But taking a look on the operational level, what does that mean? Do we talk about the often stressed ""low hanging fruit"" approach? Or is this an option making only sense for very specific industries?, What are the risk?</strong></p>
<p>I will obviously not be able to answer all of this questions in full detail, but it is a <strong>start to dive a little bit deeper into what Demand Response means for industry.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>What is ""Demand-Response""?</strong></h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>(Electric) demand side management (DSM) focuses on changing the electricity consumption patterns of end-use customers through improving energy efficiency and optimizing allocation of power. Demand response (DR) is a DSM solution which is developed to reduce or to shift demand at a specific time for a specific duration. Dynamic pricing and tariffs are applied to deliver financial value for the end-user.</p>
<h3><strong>An example: an incentive based DR solution</strong></h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>As always, live is complex.<br /> So let’s consider the situation for which enabling demand response would mean that the DR Service provider issue a set of demand response signals and transmit them to the participating customers in the form of a mandatory command. In this case, controllable loads – e.g Direct Load Control – can be reduced or interrupted upon receipt of a signal from the utility.</p>
<p>Several constraints need to be taken into account. This includes: minimum advance notice for receiving the DR signal, maximum duration for the event, the maximum number of times that the customer may receive a DR signal in a day or the maximum number of consecutive days it may receive a DR signal during a season/year, exercise fee payable to the customer upon compliance with a DR event, penalty fee payable to the utility upon failure to comply with it.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of applications using the energy, demand reduction could lead to inconvenience experienced by the end-users; for industrial application e.g this means the risk of interruption of services and/or production.</p>
<h3><strong>Case of an industrial plant as customer</strong></h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The consumption level of the industrial sector is often the bigger portion of the total load served by the utility. For many utilities industrial customers are only representing 2-10% of total customers but account for at least 80% of the electricity usage. This further emphasizes the importance of the role of the industrial sector in DR.</p>
<p>Implementation of DR for industrial customers is facing complex challenges.<br /> An industrial customer may reduce its consumption through using on-site generation, energy storage, shifting the demand to a different time, curtailment of noncritical loads such as lighting, or through temporary shut-down of one or more processes. The last approach could potentially lead to a considerable reduction in demand; however, it poses some unique challenges. Depending on the criticality of the processes shut down, the number of workstations available, the required throughput, the maintenance schedule, the crew constraints and inventory restrictions, shutting down a process may create long-term impacts on the overall process line, hence making DR non-justifiable economically.</p>
<p>So then, what need to be taken into account when implementing DR in industry?&nbsp;<br /> There are various operational constraints and the interrelations of the workstations to be considered by operators when making the input-out decision during a utility initiated demand response event. Indeed, even workstations in industry plant may undergo a curtailment.</p>
<h3><strong>Industrial process operations - constraints and requirements</strong></h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The following list is just highlighting some key factors which need to be considered from an industry perspective</p>
<ol> 	<li>Throughput time of finished products.<br /> 	Throughput time is the amount of time it takes to turn the raw materials to finished products. By definition, throughput time is the sum of all the tasks involved in the production of the end product plus any wait time in the process. As a result,<br /> 	- variations in manufacturing, such as maintenance and demand curtailment affect the throughput time and<strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 	- </strong>different workstations have different task times based on the nature of the tasks and the number of crew. Thereby, the selection of a workstation for shut down as part of the demand curtailment program will need to consider its effect on meeting the customers demand with the given runtime.</li> 	<li>The total runtime of a workstation<br /> 	The total runtime also accounts for any scheduled maintenance that will occur at each one. An effective way for minimizing the impact of scheduled maintenance on the throughput time of the operation is crosstraining the crew members to work on different workstations. By training the crew to work on different workstations, there will not be idle time and wasted labor. Moreover, customer demand can be met on time, and finally, the crew can help at bottle-neck workstations to minimize the inventory buildup.</li> 	<li>Inventory<br /> 	The potential increase in the work-in-process inventory caused by the demand reduction program. In order to determine the capital value of this inventory buildup, the products can be divided into 3 different categories:<br /> 	A: The products in the A category have the highest value in the organization<br /> 	B: which consists of important products, but is less strictly monitored<br /> 	C: relatively less important than the other two; although, it usually has larger quantities. This categorization can facilitate the selection of workstations for demand curtailment.<br /> 	If the shutdown of a workstation will lead to a high level of buildup of product categories A and B, this workstation may not be a good candidate for demand curtailment.</li> 	<li>Characteristics of the workstations<br /> 	This refers to the capacity and the configuration of the workstations. The capacity of each workstation defines the rate at which it processes products per unit of time while the configuration of workstations describes how the workstations are arranged and the flow of products. Having several workstations work in parallel makes the selection of workstations easier for demand curtailment. Having workstations in series, or having several workstations feed into a common workstation will require more attention and prioritization to minimize adverse effects of demand curtailment on the manufacturing process.</li> </ol>
<p>Before you think that´s too complex, hence why should an industrial client sign up for a Demand Response offer of its utility or an intermediate servivce provider - wait for my <strong>next post on ""Intelligent Demand Response""</strong></p>

<p>IoT, some call it industrie4.0, has brought a new breath in the whole industrial production process by allowing the physical and digital world to merge together. This will result in increasing productivity, efficiency, reduction of production costs...and many other positive effects even though there are tough non-technical challenges ahead (change old habits &amp; mindsets, new skill requirements and also greater competition).</p>

<h3><strong>Facts: The requirements in industrial production are becoming more sophisticated.</strong></h3>
<ol> 	<li>The necessity to have products that precisely meet expectations which are becoming more and more sharpened</li> 	<li>Companies have to deal with new competitors (see the impact of Google's announcement of driverless cars has already on the old car industry!)</li> </ol>
<p>Hence companies need to merge the fields of systems engineering, computer and economics to achieve the level of efficiency and quality desired.</p>
<h3><strong>The potential :</strong></h3>
<ul> 	<li>The number of Internet users worldwide is estimated at nearly 3 billions today</li> 	<li>Some experts estimate that in 2020, the number of connected devices could exceed 50 billion</li> 	<li>11.1 USD trillion per year in 2025: this is the global economic impact of IoT applications</li> 	<li>Numerous analysts and experts expect 50 percent of this materializing in industry.</li> 	<li>Today, most of IoT data are not used, e.g only 1 percent of data from an oil rig with 30,000 sensors is examined. The data that are used today are mostly for anomaly detection and control, not optimization and prediction, which provide the greatest value.</li> </ul>
<h3><strong>Network connectivity: the key factor</strong></h3>
<p>Today, the network is the determining factor in IoT. The role is so important that we note the very rapid improvements regarding the quality and network performance. These improvements in network coupled with big data tools and intelligence applications are drivers for hyper connectivity in industry.<br /> Example: End-to-end digital engineering in every manufacturing facility where machinery is a unit of a set of connected devices. Continuously performed measurements and data analysis allow to</p>
<ul> 	<li>anticipate maintenance issues before machines break. Advantage: workflow interruptions are minimized.</li> </ul>
<ul> 	<li>identify factors that will improve efficiency and throughput.</li> </ul>
<h3>&nbsp;<strong>5 levels of connectivity</strong></h3>
<ol> 	<li><strong>Shop floor to top floor – intra company vertical integration:</strong><br /> 	The first level of integration is to connect business systems to shop floor systems. Generally, systems on the top shop floor are separated from the the business systems. Shop floor systems are standalone and unique to each factory or line requirements. the rampant proliferation of localised deployments has led to disparate but dedicated systems for manufacturing planning, execution, process control, and tracking and tracing for each plant.</li> 	<li><strong>Machine-to-Machine – Autonomous machines (M2M)</strong><br /> 	The main idea is to use machines which are able to self-diagnose and self-correct by changing parameters to meet overall objectives. This leads to use of sensors in machines and production lines. Depending on the level of performance desired, the number of sensors can drastically increase. A typical example is a downstream machine which has detected a problem and needs to slow down can request the upstream machine to decrease its speed in order to slow down the line.</li> 	<li><strong>eCommerce Integration - Direct integration of online configurations</strong><br /> 	This concerns the customer design-oriented companies that offer customers the possibility to deeply configure and customize their product ordered online. The need here is to install an automated remote management system for customization whose input is the verbal command from the client and the output is the robot arms that manufacture the product.</li> 	<li><strong>Manufacturing collaboration – visibility – genealogy – quality – direct replenishment</strong><br /> 	The main objective is communication in real time between different stakeholders in industrial production. These are among other suppliers, design partners, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and customers who interact with each other ensuring that stakeholders interests are met. A classic example is the case where the supplier and the contract manufacturer communicate with the shop floor and business systems. In this case, machines on the shop floor can send replenishment signals directly the suppliers. Then, machines in the contract manufactures location can constantly update the OEM according the status of production orders and the fitting with the schedules.</li> 	<li><strong>Machine Cloud – Predictive Maintenance – Predictive Quality</strong><br /> 	Without manually impacting on performance machines, the idea is to remotely manage the sites and reduce the presence of owners, operator or manufacturer hands on machines during operation. This shows advantages regarding performances on preventive and proactive maintenance. Another aspect of IoT is related to data collected from sensors and telemetry which can be merge with business data in order to make decision regarding the business model needed to follow up.</li> </ol>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Nowadays it is no longer right to say that IoT is still in development: It already enters its maturing phase. Indeed IoT in industry has already reached a high penetration rate.</p>
<p>Still, we are far from imagining all solutions IoT can bring to the industry.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;<strong>And a few final remarks</strong></h3>
<ol> 	<li>IoT or industrie4.0 are just ""words"" and what´s behind is still often seen as something ""theoretical"", especially as many discussions are focussing on ""IT"".</li> 	<li>It becomes more tangible when discussing ""USE CASES"" and the business case behind.</li> </ol>
<p>What we need are ""<em><strong>entrance uses case</strong></em>s"" and energy efficiency can play a major role here. When you start thinking of the different levels of connectivity as mentioned above, you might be able to easier understand what IoT can deliver. And once you have started, it becomes much easier to also elaborate on its further potential.</p>

1039,"Energy Culture – Improving industrial energy efficiency through behavioral change",NULL,NULL,"<p>Despite the efforts made over the last 20 years, research suggests that there remains an important potential to reduce energy consumption in energy intensive industry by 15-25%. The same research indicates that energy management and behavioral changes can achieve up to half of this remaining energy efficiency potential. At the same time, energy management systems have in some cases failed to produce the systematic energy performance improvements that should be observed. Why is that so? In our work we have identified a company’s “Energy Culture” as a key factor in this regard. In many case, the failure to capitalize on the full energy efficiency potential can be linked to a poor Energy Culture. Improving this vital aspect of a company’s operation requires serious commitment from senior management since it involves the entire organization and it takes time. On the positive side, it usually requires limited capital expenditure and the potential energy saving ranges between 5-20%. This paper describes the methodology that we have developed to evaluate and improve an organization’s Energy Culture.</p>
<h3>What is Energy Culture?</h3>

<p>When asked, “What is culture?” many answers that it is what people think. Our definition of Energy Culture is the shared mindset that creates and sustains an environment conducive to continual improvement of the energy performance of an organization. As such, it comprises people, systems, structure, skills and strategy.</p>
<p>The developed methodology is based on a long history of work on “Safety Culture”, successful energy optimization project implementations in industry, continuous improvement methodologies as well as methodologies for leading change. The continuous improvement philosophy serves as basis for the approach and the different phases of a project are shown in Figure 1.<br /> &nbsp;</p>

<p>Figure 2. The eight dimensions of Energy Culture with three different levels of maturity</p>
<p>This stage of the assessment usually includes surveys, interviews, workshops, observations and operational data analysis. Each of these tools provides a different type of information on the Energy Culture of the organization. For example, surveys typically bring knowledge about people’s perception of how things are done, while operational data analysis provides information about behavioral impact on process performance. It is also through data analysis that you can identify the impact behavioral change can have on the energy performance. Once the assessment has been completed, the result is presented in the form of a spider diagram as seen in Figure 2. Depending on an organization’s maturity level, its ambition, commitment and budget, a target is set for the next 12 to 24 months. In most cases, two target levels are used; one that can be attained relatively easily and one that is more ambitious. Experience shows that this second target often acts as a strong motivator.</p>
<p>In each of the eight dimensions, the organization’s performance is expressed as a maturity level. Table 1 contains some examples of the typical conditions to which the different levels correspond. In many cases these conditions cover multiple dimensions. This is also true for the actions that are implemented to improve a specific dimension. In other words, most improvement actions will have an impact on multiple dimensions.</p>

<p>In the solution development phase of the project, an action plan is developed to improve the different dimensions. To allow for the necessary momentum to be created and to avoid projects to run over too long a time period, action plans are divided into six months increments.</p>
<p>In addition to efforts aimed at improving the maturity levels of the dimensions, the action plans also comprise activities related to the change process itself. As mentioned before, behavioral and cultural change takes time and commitment. Hence, a set of integrated actions is required such as setting up a task force, creating a vision for the change, proper communication, removing barriers for change and creating quick-wins to motivate people. Clearly, the fact that action plans typically run for 12 - 24 months does not imply that the change in the Energy Culture of an organization can be realized in this timeframe. Experience shows that in most cases, a much longer period is needed.</p>
<p>Once an agreed action plan has been established, the organization initiates its implementation. Some opt to do this by their own means, but most of them seek support of external and specialized experts. Essential is to regularly measure progress during this phase. The quantitative evaluation consists of the energy performance itself, which can be compared to a baseline developed during or prior to the diagnostic phase. In addition, a qualitative evaluation comprising surveys, observations and interviews, is recommended. Based on the feedback from these evaluations, the approach can be fine-tuned and streamlined along the way.</p>
<p>Finally, upon completion of the implementation phase, a final evaluation is made and a new plan is developed to continue the change and to secure the results achieved thus far. This moves the organization into the sustaining phase of the project.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>In many organizations, a far-reaching change in its Energy Culture is needed to fully unlock the remaining energy efficiency improvement potential. Experience from recent projects shows savings ranging from 5% to 20% with no or small capital investment. The main success criteria for effectively improving the Energy Culture of an organization are the commitment, buy-in, support and perseverance of the senior management.</p>

<p>In the <a href=""http://www.ee-ip.org/sites/default/files/Final_Report_EEFIG_v_9.1_24022015_clean_FINAL_sent.pdf"" target=""_blank"">report</a>, EEFIG identifies the critical success factors, policies, market instruments and financing solutions to increase energy efficiency investments in Europe in the buildings, industry and SME sectors. On the launch event European Commission Vice President, Maroš Šef?ovi? said the following: ""Investing into energy efficiency measures in buildings, industry and in SMEs is fundamentally important for Europe. I will strive to ensure that energy efficiency investment financing is looked at in our forthcoming policies and that this Report will be used as inspiration for our further work.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Director of UNEP, Achim Steiner underlines that: ""Scaling up energy efficiency investment has become an economic imperative with a strong social, environmental and competitive rationale. And while European industry remains a global leader in energy efficiency, investment flows in the sector remain sub-optimal. Only half of the estimated 60 -100 billion Euros annual investment required to achieve Europe's 2020 energy efficiency targets in buildings is being met. The joint efforts by the EU and UNEP's FI to build a healthy dialogue among stakeholders and disseminate know-how has the potential to unleash private investment to the scale required to meet future ambitions and obligations.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>Banks and long-term investor members of EEFIG also welcomed the report: Urs Rohner, Chairman of Credit Suisse Group AG said ""Our research demonstrates that Europe can probably save another 10 to 15% of energy by 2030 with appropriate energy efficiency measures. Energy efficiency investment benefits Europe’s environmental as well as economic growth targets by conserving resources and reducing costs. We see investor interest in energy efficiency escalating rapidly in particular around the transition to sustainable buildings, with great opportunities ahead for green building-related businesses"".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fostering energy efficiency investments is a driver of competitiveness, economic value, innovation and employment across the European Union. The benefits are: &nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li>Strong economic, social and competitive rationale for the up-scaling of energy efficiency investments in industry and buildings in the EU;</li> 	<li>Boosting both the drivers of demand for and supply of energy efficiency investments in buildings and industry sub-segments offers a strong economic opportunity</li> 	<li>Whilst there is no single solution, EEFIG identifies a framework of cross-cutting measures as well as individual requirements to support investments for each market segment, while noting national differences especially in low income countries;</li> 	<li>In its analysis of the different tools and approaches, EEFIG identifies those which can be led by market stakeholders and those which must be policy-led. Both require work in parallel to deliver the targeted increase in energy efficiency investments;</li> 	<li>For industry EEFIG develops separate analysis and recommendations to policy makers and market participants to increase energy efficiency investment rates and flows;</li> 	<li>EEFIG concludes by highlighting seven key themes which emerge from both buildings and industry and SME analysis and provide the European Commission with final recommendations for its consideration.</li> </ul>

1041,"Efficient Steel Production in India",NULL,NULL,"<h3><strong>How technology and training can green India’s steel re-rolling industry</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>With a booming economy, demand for construction materials has skyrocketed in India. In particular, the need for steel has grown in recent years, with production registering a cumulative annual growth rate of around 7 percent over the last few years. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While the steel industry is a key contributor to the Indian economy, it is also responsible for large amounts of waste and greenhouse gas emissions. Steel production is very energy intensive – and energy efficiency processes haven’t yet filtered into the daily operations of steel mills in India. But that is changing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were excited to be part of an energy efficiency project for the steel re-rolling sector in Bhavnagar, a medium-sized city in the western state of Gujarat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bhavnagar is home to the biggest steel rolling mill cluster in Gujarat. Like other steel re-rolling mills, the cluster creates commonly-used products like bars and structural steel by rolling heated stock in a rolling mill. The sector by and large relies on raw materials like ingots, billets and various kinds of scrap – but in Bhavnagar, eighty percent of mills use steel plates from recycled ships sourced from Alang, one of the world’s largest ship-breaking yard. In 2011-12 alone, the yard processed 415 ships (3.86 million tonnes), and provided direct employment to 50,000 people and indirect employment to hundreds of thousands of workers. It truly is an economic powerhouse for the region.</p>
<p>In fact, the steel re-rolling sector as a whole is one of the most important segments of India’s entire steel industry. It began in earnest in 1928 and there are now around 1800 mills in operation in India. The sector is largely dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises (representing 75 percent of the sector), which enjoy a competitive edge over larger producers due to their flexibility in producing smaller volumes for niche markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the operating efficiency of these small units is dismally poor, leading not only to huge energy losses but also significant wastage of raw material. There is a tremendous opportunity to save resources by cutting fuel and raw material use through technology modernization. Doing this on a large scale would also lead to significantly improved pollution loading (locally and globally) and a better workplace environment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To demonstrate the potential, we worked with a steel rolling cluster that sourced its scrap from the Alang ship-breaking yard. The major source of fuel for the cluster is pulverized coal, a dirty fuel that produces large amounts of greenhouses gases and pollution when burned. We chose to work with the cluster because of its potential to reduce its CO2 emissions through energy efficiency measures, including improving its poor furnace design so it can reduce coal use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were other challenges that hampered their ability to run efficient operations – many of which are not limited to this city alone. The majority of mill owners are first generation industrialists without any formal technical education. Even the foreman and mill staff did not have formal training, instead acquiring their skills on the job. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, the steel re-rolling industry also faces a number of market failures, with limited access to finance, technology and market-related information. This situation is compounded by the lack of effective delivery systems for supporting cleaner production uptake at an industry level.</p>
<p>To help overcome all these barriers, we carried out a feasibility study and, armed with better information, we helped improve the design and function of a reheating furnace used by the cluster. This was supported by other measures to ensure proper management of the new technology, including training the plant operators and supervisors, monitoring improvements, and partnering with the Shihor Steel Re-rolling Mills Association to ensure the cluster had ongoing support. Importantly, we also helped identify a financing partner to ensure the initiative was a success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a direct result of the improved technology, the thermal efficiency of the furnace grew from a mere 21 percent to 30.5 percent; and fuel use dropped by 23 percent, which in absolute terms equates to 75 kg per ton of product, down from 97 kg per ton of product. Annually, the improvements saved 330 tonnes of coal. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Bhavnagar’s steel re-rolling mills are not unique in having inefficient technologies and a lack of awareness of energy efficiency. If replicated across India, this model could contribute to vast reductions in CO2 emissions – meaning the sector could maintain its strong economic position while greening its production.&nbsp;</p>

1042,"Efficient EU policy for efficient EU industry",NULL,NULL,"<h3><strong>Energy and its central role in ferro-alloys production</strong></h3>
<p>Ferro-alloys and silicon production is highly energy-intensive. Energy cost is one of the main competitive factors for the industry and thus energy efficiency is sought where possible. Energy efficiency measures taken by industry also have the added benefit of reducing CO2 emissions, and thus energy efficiency and climate efforts are closely linked in industrial decision-making.</p>
<h3><strong>Closer alignment on EU climate and energy policy</strong></h3>
<p>Hence the proposed new structure of the EU institutions, where energy and climate policy will be linked, is well received by our industry. The future European Commission team shows a commitment to the mainstreaming of competitiveness and industry policy, in line with the 20% target for industry in EU GDP by 2020, that we warmly welcome.</p>
<p>The time when the world will firmly commit to action against climate change has not yet come; the EU ETS has no equivalent in competing regions (while some of the emerging systems have learned from EU’s mistakes).</p>
<p>The main concerns of energy-intensive industries are rising energy costs and increasing uncertainty regarding EU climate policy. European industry is faced with higher energy prices than our major competitors and there is a growing need to look for solutions. In particular, the indirect cost of CO2 included in the electricity price must be efficiently addressed through new policies.</p>
<p>Climate policy - and in particular the constant changes and interferences to the ETS market - are of major concern. The emission reductions seen in industry have partly come due to the economic downturn with resulting reduction of production instead of innovation in low-carbon technologies.</p>
<h3><strong>Enabling innovation for a more energy efficient future</strong></h3>
<p>The European Commission rightly considers innovation as the key to achieve a low-carbon society. European ferro-alloys companies have been early movers and are already among the most climate-efficient in the world. &nbsp;However, further improvements in efficiency and technology require investments. And to justify investments industry must be competitive and profitable while the policy framework must be proficient and predictable. European industry has the competence and the will to innovate and seek out new, more energy efficient solutions. However, for as long as there is no global climate agreement, the playing field must be levelled through sufficient protection against carbon leakage. Only then can industry have the predictable framework required to take a leap in innovation and apply new technology to cut energy consumption and emissions. The Commission should also look at funding options that may speed up this process. One example can be found in Norway, where state support has enabled 15 TWh (almost 12% of annual total consumption) invested in energy efficiency measures and several ground-breaking R&amp;D projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The “old continent” has been an early mover on climate policy but industrial investments are suffering... The EU now needs to learn from its policy mistakes and make the necessary changes in order to lead the global shift. And with a supportive and predictable policy framework the European (ferro-alloys) industry has the means, will and competence to be a vehicle for change.</p>"

(<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032111004308"" target=""_blank"">source</a>)</li> </ul>
<p>We will see what happens in the near future if they were right.</p>
<p>Besides the macro-perspective, let's have a closer look on the technical and economical side. What remains true is that VSD will only be broadly implemented if it is technically meaningful and economically viable!</p>
<h3><strong>Where VSD can be implemented in industry...-nearly everywhere!</strong></h3>
<p>In industry, there is a significant amount of rotary machines of various types such as electric motors on the one hand, and on the other hand loads which are pumps, fans, compressors...which are coupled to the motor to form a rotary system.A common factor in these machines is that they are mostly designed for rotation at constant speed and therefore provide a constant output. Thus they rotate at 100 percent of speed for short duration.</p>
<p>This means, they are most of the time not effectively using energy. And - ""side effect""- this energy waste increases carbon emissions. This has led to the idea of using variable speed machine processes with VSD motors.</p>
<p>Many of industry players all agreed on the fact that VSD has many advantages. And it's true.</p>
<p>Indeed,...</p>
<ul> 	<li>Electric motors consumption represents up to 75 percent of total plant's energy consumption</li> 	<li>Additionnally, two-thirds of motorized equipment need to work at variable speed e.g pumps, fans, compressors.</li> </ul>
<p>VSD systems can not only save from 15 percent up to 40 percent of energy but also it extends equipment lifetime thanks to its soft start-up/shutdown function.</p>
<h3><strong>How it works?</strong></h3>
<p>Basically, VSD systems consist of three basic components: the electric motor, the power converter, and the control system.</p>
<ol> 	<li>The electric motor is connected directly of indirectly to the load</li> 	<li>The power converter controls the power flow an AC supply (often via a supply transformer) to the motor by</li> 	<li>Appropriate control of power semiconductor switches which are part of the power converter.</li> </ol>
<p>VSD are also known as VFD, ASD... which are somehow similar in opeation principle.</p>
<h3><strong>And the economic side of VSD?</strong></h3>
<p>There is always a case by case story. But the story behind is simple as this example shows:</p>
<ul> 	<li>considering a system of 12-pulse/200Hp drive with a total value of 51,000 $ with 20,000 $ for the 200 Hp constant speed motor and 31,000 for the ASD system cost.</li> 	<li>The installed ASD system would save energy cost of 17,590 $ annually.</li> </ul>
<p>Although this is only an indication , it shows that it is possible to have a <strong>payback after 15 months</strong> assuming total net cost installation of 21,210 $ as an example.</p>
<p>And there are further beneficial aspects:</p>
<ul> 	<li>the potential of extending the life of the equipment and</li> 	<li>the reduction of greenhouse gases.</li> </ul>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>VSD are key tools for an industry that is strongly motorized and automated. They deliver multiple benefits ranging from lower total cost of ownership via energy cost&nbsp; reduction, longer life-time as well as a reduction of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>And there is still huge potential!</p>
<p>Still, many question remain unanswered...</p>
<ul> 	<li>What is the time plan?</li> 	<li>How long it will take to fully leverage the energy savings potential of VSDs?</li> 	<li>What is the impact of ""locked investments""=exixting NON VSD motors in place?</li> 	<li>What is the annual replacement rate of the electrical motors in the industry and can this rate be accelerated?</li> </ul>

1044,"How Twitter can drive energy transition policy advocacy in Europe",NULL,NULL,"
<p>Twitter community management usually splits between audience building (getting followers) and driving engagement (getting shares and likes). Here we are adding third level: Twitter collaboration - joining forces for collaborative actions for common goal in policy or advocacy.</p>
<p>Since 2010, <a href=""http://www.ee-ip.org"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes (EEIP)</a> has grown its social media outreach to over 100,000 subscribers, establishing EEIP as the global leader in communications on energy efficiency. This summer a revolution in using social media to energise energy efficiency and energy transition communications happened in Brussels.

<p>Collaboration is the foundation for effective use of social media. In order to support EU policies on energy efficiency, renewable energy and energy transition, an active community between associations and organisations committed for energy transition has been established. <a href=""http://twitter.com/search?q=%23tw4se"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Twitter for Sustainable Energy (#Tw4SE)</a> group started with interest and involvement of over 40 different sectors and advocacy groups. The first tasks included support and training on effective use of Twitter facilitated&nbsp;by Vattel.

<p>A response to setting up #Tw4SE community is very encouraging. The initial engagement suggests that we have tapped into the unexpected potential for cross-EU Association collaboration in joint efforts to bring the energy transition to the forefront of the European energy policy. Collaborative use of social media is a step change. 'CoTweeting', exchanging ideas and information should become a best practice in Twitter for policy and advocacy. In developing social media communications strategies, collaboration should be embedded as a potential engine behind the audience building and engagement.</p>

According to the Grundfos initiative “Meet The Energy Challenge – NOW”, pumps alone account for10 % of the world´s electricity consumption.&nbsp; (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://energy.grundfos.com/en/facts-on-pumps-energy/the-surprising-truth-about-pumps"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">http://energy.grundfos.com/en/facts-on-pumps-energy/the-surprising-truth-about-pumps</a>)</p>
<h3>The challenge</h3>
<p>Today, potential clients searching for energy efficient solutions are using more and more online and social media channels to find relevant information. And relevant information is not a salesfolder or a technical product sheet. Clients are looking for available solutions - or even better - applied solutions including underlying business cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For many suppliers this is a real challenge.</p>
<p>Online and social media marketing have become a key tool for many companies already. But a closer look shows that this are most often the few big players with big marketing departments and budgets. What about the many SMEs in the market, the specialist often very good in engineering and with deep expertise in specific sectors. How could this companies raise their voice and visibility online?</p>
<h3>Benefits of EEIP and PMS partnership for industry</h3>

<p>Currently, the SME company websites are most often the only source for information for potential clients. Well, next to the usual expensive trade fair.</p>
<p>But as good as many SMEs are in terms of engineering capabilities, this is most often combined with lack of resources and time for marketing. And here is where our new partner PUMP MARKETING SOLUTIONS starts. Based on own deep experience in the pumps business, they help SMEs to maximise their company website potential.</p>
<p>And through our new partnership, PMS can now also offering SMEs to participate and benefit from EEIP, the globally biggest industry network for energy efficient products and services.</p>
<p>Or as PMSLLC’s President, Keith Gagnier, says. “Pumps account for more than 10% of the world’s electricity</p>

<h2>Top 5: How to increase energy efficiency of pumps – start with the system</h2>
<p>Everybody knows that pumps consume a lot of energy. But do you know that pumps currently account for 10% of the world´s total electricity consumption?</p>
<p>Here is an overview of Top 5 approaches to reduce energy consumption.</p>
<ol> 	<li>System Planning</li> 	<li>Pumps</li> 	<li>Impellers</li> 	<li>Motors</li> 	<li>Drives</li> </ol>

<h3>System Planning</h3>
<p>Pumping systems are designed to meet many requirements, energy efficiency not always being one of them. As a result, some plants are built with poor system design where pumps are not properly matched to the system, pipe diameters are incorrectly sized and flow velocities are too high. Bad plant layout resulting in inefficient routing of pipes frequently exacerbates the situation as well.</p>
<p>As all these factors increase frictional resistance, larger pumps than necessary are needed to deliver liquid to the required service.</p>
<h3>Existing systems</h3>
<p>Changing a running system already in place is often difficult. Sometimes pumps, valves and measuring instruments are modified, for example to optimise a system’s available net positive suction head (NPSH), gather measurement information or change suction and/or discharge flanges, when retrofitting differently sized new pumps. Due to the heavy expenditure for engineering and materials, such modifications are usually limited in scale and often have little impact on the energy efficiency of an existing system.</p>
<p>One significant exception is to employ variable speed pumping solutions that can be retrofitted into a system already in service. Another viable option is to check whether any&nbsp;duty points can be subsequently rescaled, because each system is designed with safety margins added to the calculated system curves to ensure that sufficiently large pumps are selected for the job. As a result, the pumps installed are often oversized and then operate at excessive flow rates or in throttled conditions, increasing energy usage and reducing pump life.</p>
<h3>New systems</h3>
<p>Competent planning of new pumping systems to minimise energy consumption is one of the keys to reducing life cycle costs (LCC). Some energy use may not be output-dependent. For example, a control system sensing output changes may itself generate a constant energy load, whereas a variable speed drive can consume different levels of energy at different operating settings. Throttle valves, pressure relief mechanisms and flow bypasses used for control will all reduce operating efficiency and increase energy consumption. Additional costs may be caused by cooling or heating circuits, liquid flush lines or fluid barrier arrangements. While such costs often do not vary for different types of systems, they can be influenced by the selection of materials and designs.</p>
<p>Carefully selected pumping systems will reduce energy costs. A system’s overall frictional resistance can be minimised and the monetary savings maximised if attention is paid to the following points:</p>
<ul> 	<li>Pumps must be optimally matched to the system in an early stage.</li> 	<li>Variable speed drives should be chosen, pipe diameters and distances correctly selected and flow velocities optimally designed for each position where they will help reduce energy consumption.<br /> 	&nbsp;</li> </ul>

<h4>How this looks in practice?</h4>

<h1>Do you know where you stand? ‘Energy Efficiency Barometer’ taking stock of manufacturing sectors’ position on energy efficiency</h1>
<p>How energy efficient is production in the industrial sectors? How does my company perform in comparison to others and what can I do?</p>
<p>The Institute for Energy Efficiency in Production (EEP) at the University of Stuttgart, semi-annually computes the Energy Efficiency Barometer of the Industry, in collaboration with Fraunhofer IPA, Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes (EEIP), Linköping University, the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation (ECCI) and the Alliance to Save Energy.</p>
<p>The Barometer sheds light on the current state of energy efficiency in the producing industry and allows a look into the future regarding&nbsp;importance, investment and productivity. The special issue questions further capture companies’ views on current topics.</p>
<p>For the seventh time, the Institute for Energy Efficiency in Production (EEP) is currently taking the pulse of companies: With the Energy Efficiency Index of the German Industry and (international) Energy Efficiency Barometer of the Industry it describes a path for evidence-based decision-making in companies, for policy makers and financiers.</p>
<h4><strong>We would very much welcome your particiaption.

Many thanks!</h4>

<h3>Taking the pulse of companies</h3>
<p>Aimed at companies of 28 industrial sectors, participants will find out</p>
<ul> 	<li>how important energy efficiency is to others,</li> 	<li>which strategies are being pursued and</li> 	<li>where their company stands compared to others.</li> </ul>
<p>The previous data collections have brought up valuable information on barriers, on gaps, on fundamental differences across sectors and company sizes.</p>
<p>With the sector specific analysis subscribing participants receive, companies can compare themselves with developments in their economic sector and derive strategies to accelerate the company’s energy productivity.</p>
<p>This is of high relevance, as more than half of the CO2 emissions that need to be avoided additionally to commitments countries already made in Paris, occur in the industrial sectors.</p>
<p>To make such energy productivity gains possible, it is essential to switch from ‘watering can’ approaches to ‘understanding the demand side’ tailored approaches. Shaping policies, concepts and business models that take account of the needs, the values and the realities in varied industrial sectors is something, the Energy Efficiency Index of the German Industry builds the foundation for: by reflecting businesses’ perception regarding energy efficiency and existing (or lacking) policies.</p>

<h3>Understanding the demand side</h3>
<p>With its sub-indices ‘importance’, ‘investment’ and ‘energy productivity’, the index also allows specific comparisons across economic sectors and company sizes.</p>
<p>With the Barometer, this systematic is currently extended on to further countries and prepares ground to objectively assess, inform and accompany efforts to accelerate the level of energy efficiency as a whole.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Systematic is extended on to further countries</h3>

<p>Previous results have shown that size indeed matters in many aspects, but it is not always the big companies that are the driving force. Do companies see energy-related benefit for themselves in sectoral coupling, flexibilisation and digitalization? How can transaction costs and risks be reduced? How do implemented measures actually perform?</p>
<p>All these are questions the Energy Efficiency Index is designed to find answers for, based on data from hundreds of producing companies, to find tailored policies, concepts and business models to prevent climate change and to accelerate energy productivity.</p>
<p>Do you want to find out where you stand? Please use the opportunity to participate in the 7th data collection which opened this week. It takes approximately <strong>5-10 Minutes</strong> and can be found here: &nbsp; <a href=""http://www.eep.uni-stuttgart.de/eeei/?pk_campaign=Partner%20EEIP%202016_2&amp;pk_kwd=Energieeffizienz-Index"">http://www.eep.uni-stuttgart.de/eeei/</a></p>

1052,"Turkey: Industrial energy efficiency strategy",NULL,NULL,"<h1>Turkey is creating the foundation for an effective industrial energy efficiency strategy</h1>
<p>Energy efficiency is a stated priority for both its energy and climate change policies in Turkey. Being a founding member of the International Energy Agency, Turkey has considered energy efficiency an important long-term policy area. In the 1980s, Turkey started some energy efficiency activities that continue until today – mandatory data reporting and energy managers for large industry and large buildings, awareness creation, and institutional co-ordination, to name but a few. The current strategy covers all end-use sectors and the industrial sector is given high priority.&nbsp; The sector consumes 34% of total final consumption, following only the residential/commercial sector.&nbsp; Importantly, The manufacturing industry is one of the main drivers of Turkish economy, accounting for about 24% of total GDP. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>The key drivers for improving energy efficiency in Turkey are:</h3>
<ol> 	<li>Improving energy security</li> 	<li>Reducing imports and the total energy bill</li> 	<li>Improving competitiveness of industry that is heavily oriented towards export and that is heavily energy-intensive</li> 	<li>Improving energy services to all consumers</li> 	<li>Lowering carbon used throughout energy system</li> 	<li>Reducing total environmental impact (including air quality). &nbsp;</li> </ol>
<p>The current energy efficiency strategy was approved in 2012 and sets an overall energy intensity (the amount of energy consumed per unit of GDP) target reduction of at least 20% by 2023, using 2011 as the base year. <strong>For industry, there is a sub-target to reduce energy intensities in each industry sub sector at least 10% by 2023. </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Adoption of EU policies</h3>
<p>Turkey is planning to transpose the EU Energy Efficiency Directive, that includes some obligations for the industrial sector, and has already started to undertake some of the elements of that Directive (i.e. preparation of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan).&nbsp; Turkey has also transposed the Ecodesign directive and the energy labelling directive, in large part to have access for its products to the large EU market. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Energy Efficiency activities, from OIZs to ISO50001</h3>
<p>Energy efficiency activities in the industrial sector combine both government initiatives and multilateral/bilateral support. The full range of policy instruments is used. This includes financial incentives, energy audits, mandatory reporting of annual energy consumption for large industry, mandatory energy managers, certification of energy managers, licensing of energy audit companies and promotion of energy management.&nbsp; Bilateral and multilateral projects have made a strong contribution.&nbsp; The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has some major sustainable energy funds available. One of the EBRD’s key aims is to support the development of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which are crucial to nurturing a private sector economy. It has the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.turseff.org/en"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Turkey Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (TurSEFF)</a> as well as the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.midseff.com/"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Turkey Mid-size Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (MidSEFF)</a>. The World Bank has recently provided over US$200 for energy efficiency projects in SMEs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two important developments in Turkey that are gaining great interest. A UNDP/UNIDO project on industrial energy efficiency has, inter alia, two very interest element:&nbsp; it is working to help develop energy management units in Organised Industrial Zones and it is promoting energy management systems (essentially ISO 50001) through targeted training and information. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.invest.gov.tr/en-US/investmentguide/investorsguide/Pages/SpecialInvestmentZones.aspx"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Organized Industrial Zones (OIZ)</a> are designed to allow companies to operate within an investor-friendly environment with ready-to-use infrastructure and social facilities. The existing infrastructure provided in the zones includes roads, water, natural gas, electricity, communications, waste treatment, and other services. There are about 150 that are active in Turkey.&nbsp; The Industrial energy efficiency project is working to set up energy management units in a select number of them. Six of the OIZs have now been trained and have measuring equipment provided through the UN project. They have also been given awareness materials to distribute. The idea is to have the companies within the OIZs rely more and more on the EMUs for information that is both technical and related to programs.&nbsp; On the programme side, it is important that the EMUs know, for example, all the financial mechanisms available in the country. In effect, they become one-stop-shops. These EMUs will help create awareness, can organise trainings, can encourage financial institutions to promote their services, and so on. In a new World Bank project, they will continue to build on the success of the OIZs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The second important development is <strong>how</strong> <strong>popular energy management systems (ISO 50001) have become. In 2016 it was estimated that around 100 out of 1,200 large energy-intensive industrial installations apply the standard.</strong> The UN project, in particular, has arranged for initial training for experts in companies and has also trained many local experts to become trainers themselves. They are also training some experts to be lead auditors to assess energy performance.&nbsp; ISO 50001 is gaining in popularity as companies realise the importance of an integrated company-wide approach. Early indications also show that the companies that are gaining their certification are also starting to invest in energy efficiency measures. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there more to do?&nbsp; Undoubtedly, Turkey can strengthen its policies and programmes related to industry. Both large energy-intensive industries and SMEs need help and encouragement.&nbsp; It has made good strides forward and, to its credit, it has a strong legislative foundation from which to build upon.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Vision vs. reality – why political intervention is essential to unleash heat pumps energy savings potential in industrial and commercial applications.</h2>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>





<p>Buildings need a comfortable indoor temperature</p>
<p>and air quality, temperature levels in industrial processes needs to be</p>
<p>regulated to the point, goods in storage and transport require a controlled</p>
<p>atmosphere – these are only a few examples where heating and cooling is</p>
<p>essential in a modern society.</p>
<p>Far too often both services are still</p>
<p>addressed separately. Boilers are installed to heat up, air conditioning and</p>
<p>refrigeration equipment to cool down. Rarely are both seen as two sides of the</p>
<p>same coin. As a consequence, energy stored in waste air or water is discharged</p>
<p>to the environment and thus lost for further use.</p>



<p>If in a building, hot water is heated by a</p>
<p>boiler and an a/c system is used to cool down the indoor air temperature,</p>
<p>energy is wasted. If in an industrial process, fossil energy is burned to</p>
<p>provide heating in step one and then an intermediate or final product is cooled</p>
<p>down, energy is wasted. If industrial production facilities are cooled by</p>
<p>cooling/refrigeration equipment or close-by offices are heated by separate appliances,</p>
<p>energy is wasted. <strong>In short, whenever</strong></p>
<p><strong>heating and cooling requirements are solved independent of each other, without</strong></p>
<p><strong>taking a system perspective, the likelihood of wasted energy is high. </strong></p>
<p>Heat pump technology provides heating and</p>
<p>cooling at the same time, always. It is a matter of proper system design to</p>
<p>make use of both sides and thus turn the one-way road of energy use into a</p>
<p>circular energy economy.</p>
<p>The potential of closed cycles is</p>
<p>particularly high in industrial applications. In 2015, the industrial and</p>
<p>commercial heat pump working group (ICHP) of the European Heat Pump Association</p>
<p>has studied the potential of non-domestic heat pump applications for heating</p>
<p>and cooling. The authors of that study, Philippe Nellissen and Stefan Wolf have</p>
<p>dubbed the report „potential for an industrial revolution“ [1].</p>
<p>Heat pump technologies are recognized for</p>
<p>the fact that they contribute to the EU energy and climate targets. They</p>


<ul> 	<li>reduce energy demand and CO2 emissions.</li> 	<li>integrate renewable energy and help decarbonize the system.</li> 	<li>can make use of waste heat.</li> 	<li>provide demand response potential and help stabilize the electric grid.</li> 	<li>provide local employment and keep know-how in R&amp;D</li> 	<li>use local energy and reduce import dependency.</li> </ul>

<p>Heat pump technology is widely accepted as</p>
<p>a feasible solution in the residential sector where they mainly use renewable</p>
<p>energy from air, water and ground to provide heating and hot water. Much less</p>
<p>known is the opportunity to valorise waste heat streams by upgrading their</p>
<p>temperature and thus utilize them to cover heat demands of users located</p>
<p>close-bye. This applies wherever cooling and heating are needed simultaneously</p>
<p>for example in many industrial processes in the food, paper or chemical industries.<a href=""http://www.ee-ip.org/typo3/#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</a></p>
<p>Heat pump technology can increase or lower</p>
<p>the energy level of these sources to the desired level of another application,</p>
<p>thus connecting individual energy loops into a cascade which can eventually be</p>
<p>closed again.</p>
<p>While the residential heat pump market is</p>
<p>dominated by electric compression heat pumps, a variety of heat pump</p>
<p>technologies are used in industrial and commercial applications (see fig. 1).</p>


<p><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""186"" height=""503"" src=""fileadmin/_processed_/5/c/csm_Italy_6ed7d7c582.jpg"" width=""797"" style="""" /><br /> Figure 1: Classification of heat pump</p>
<p>technologies. Source: Wolf/Nellissen 2015 [1]</p>

<p>With the <strong>currently available technology</strong>, heat pumps can provide heat on</p>
<p>temperature levels up to 100°C with a spread between source and sink</p>
<p>temperature of approx. 50 K per stage. This is important to note, as two stage</p>
<p>heat pump installations can cover a larger spread.</p>



<p><strong>The</strong></p>
<p><strong>use of heat pumps for applications with a heat demand above 100°C is still a</strong></p>
<p><strong>challenge. </strong>While the underlying principles for such</p>
<p>heat pumps are known and prototypes for these temperature levels exist, they</p>
<p>are not yet available in standard products. The current level of research and</p>
<p>development projects as well as increased interest by new players to engage in</p>
<p>the segment of large heat pumps leaves room for optimism. In the coming years,</p>
<p>a number of new products is expected in the market.</p>
<p>Without existing solutions for heat pump</p>
<p>applications for<strong> temperature levels</strong></p>
<p><strong>above 150°C </strong>this segment has not been included in the current potential</p>
<p>assessment.</p>
<p>With this in mind, available data from</p>
<p>Eurostat for was evaluated to determine the potential for the application of</p>
<p>heat pumps in these industrial sectors:</p>



<ol> 	<li>Iron and steel/non-ferrous metals</li> 	<li>Chemical and petroleum</li> 	<li>Non-metallic minerals</li> 	<li>Paper, pulp and print</li> 	<li>food and tobacco machinery</li> 	<li>Wood and wood products</li> 	<li>Transport equipment</li> 	<li>Textile and leather</li> 	<li>Others</li> </ol>




<p>2012 data for EU-28 reveals, that the</p>
<p>industry is using 3200 TWh of final energy and a demand for heat of approx.</p>
<p>2000 TWh. Figure 2 shows the split of this heat demand per sector analysed and</p>
<p>temperature range covered.</p>


<p><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""187"" height=""406"" src=""fileadmin/_processed_/3/e/csm_data_mining_big_data_f16674ce09.png"" width=""811"" style="""" /></p>


<p>Figure 2: Distinction of heat demand in</p>
<p>industry by sector and temperature range. [1]</p>
<p>This assessment reveals a <strong>practically reachable potential for heat</strong></p>
<p><strong>pumps</strong> in the temperature range up to 100°C of 68 TWh, mainly in the chemical,</p>
<p>paper, food/tobacco and wood industries (see blue shaded bars in fig. 2).</p>
<p>Adding the sectors of hot water and space heating reveals an additional 74 TWh</p>
<p>(see orange shaded bars in fig. 2). With technical progress, an additional</p>
<p>potential of 32TWh in the temperature range from 100 to 150°C can be made accessible</p>
<p>(see darkest blue bar in fig.2). In total, 174 TWh or 8.7% of all heat demand</p>
<p>in industry can be provided by heat pumps.</p>



<p>The higher temperature ranges shown in grey</p>
<p>in the graph above remain inaccessible for heat pump technology.</p>
<p>The result of</p>
<p>this assessment shows the <strong>realistic</strong></p>
<p><strong>potential of heat pump applications. The technical potential is much larger,</strong></p>
<p><strong>but can often not be fully used due to practical considerations. </strong></p>



<p>A more refined, model based analysis executed</p>
<p>by Wolf and Blesl comes to the conclusion, that the technical potential of heat</p>
<p>pump use in industry across the 28 EU member states is 1717 PJ (477 TWh), with</p>
<p>only 270 (75 TWh) or 15% of it being accessible if economic and practical</p>
<p>considerations are applied. [2]</p>
<p>Thus the model based approach leads to a</p>
<p>larger technical potential, but to a much lower economic potential.</p>
<p>Main factors influencing the economic</p>
<p>perspective of heat pump operations are</p>



<ul> 	<li>Cost of fossil fuels</li> 	<li>Cost of electricity</li> 	<li>Interest rate</li> 	<li>Efficiency of the heat pump system</li> 	<li>Simultaneous availability of heat supply and heat demand, simultaneous demand for heating and cooling</li> 	<li>Investment cost differences.</li> </ul>




<p>Operation cost savings from heat pump use</p>
<p>are possible, if the relative cost of fossil fuels and electricity are smaller</p>
<p>than the efficiency of the heat pump system. With a rather distorted energy</p>
<p>price, this is more and more difficult, as many governments recover the cost of</p>
<p>greening the electric system via electricity cost itself. At the same time the</p>
<p>price for fossil fuels does not reflect the negative environmental impact of</p>
<p>its use. Thus relative cost of heat provision points in favour of fossil fuels.</p>

<p><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""188"" height=""643"" src=""fileadmin/_processed_/e/e/csm_HM_EnergyEfficiency_a38f91f416.jpg"" width=""978"" style="""" /><br /> Figure 3: Industrial heat pump potential in</p>
<p>EU-28 [2]</p>
<p>Since there is a direct relation between</p>
<p>energy demand reduction and CO2 emissions, extending the economic potential of</p>
<p>demand reduction will also reduce CO2 emissions from the industrial sector. The</p>
<p>study concludes a total CO2 emission reduction potential of 86,2 Mt with 21,5</p>
<p>Mt (25%) of it economically viable.</p>
<p><strong>Obstacles,</strong></p>
<p><strong>challenges and opportunities</strong></p>



<p>Main obstacles limiting the use of heat</p>
<p>pump in industry are as follows:</p>


<ul> 	<li>Extreme requirements on a return of investment, often not more than 2 years are accepted. This is further complicated by a comparatively low price for fossil energy.</li> 	<li>Risk aversion, in particular vs. heat pumps which are not trusted, but perceived as a new, unproven technology.</li> 	<li>Limited or no availability of best practise examples that could create trust in new solutions.</li> 	<li>Structural barriers in the industry</li> </ul>




<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>High transaction cost for the</p>
<p>conversion of processes, as many old processes are based on steam</p>



<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Need to integrate competences</p>
<p>and responsibilities to realise a systems perspective in order to energetically</p>
<p>optimise industrial processes and commercial applications</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong></p>
<p><strong>the energy savings and CO2 abatement potential of heat pumps in industrial</strong></p>
<p><strong>applications is still largely unused. </strong>Creating more</p>
<p>favourable political framework conditions will allow to reverse this trend.</p>
<p>These include</p>





<ul> 	<li>Adding a price signal to the use of fossil fuel</li> 	<li>Reduce the burden from tax and levys on increasingly clean electricity</li> 	<li>Provide low interest rates and loan guarantees to energy efficient investments using low carbon emission technologies such as heat pumps</li> 	<li>Increase research and development on standardized heat pump solutions for the identified industrial sectors</li> 	<li>Provide more best practise examples.</li> </ul>






<p>There is a joint effort necessary from</p>
<p>policy makers and industry alike to develop the technical and economic</p>
<p>potential of heat pump applications in industry. It needs both to pull on the</p>
<p>same string (and in the same direction) to fully unleash the potential.</p>

<h2>Recognising industry’s contribution to clean&nbsp;energy</h2>
<p>The European Commission has published its proposals for the contribution of clean energy in meeting the EU’s obligations for the Paris climate agreement.</p>
<p>Published on 30 November, the “<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/news/commission-proposes-new-rules-consumer-centred-clean-energy-transition"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">winter package</a>” is appropriately entitled “<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/news/commission-proposes-new-rules-consumer-centred-clean-energy-transition"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Clean Energy for All Europeans</a>”. The Communication proposes a binding target for energy saving for 2030 and it includes recommendations to adapt the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/1_en_act_part1_v16.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Energy Efficiency Directive</a>, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, and other existing guidance.</p>
<p>The Communication states the three main goals as:</p>

<ol> 	<li><a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-3986_en.htm"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window""><strong>Putting energy efficiency first</strong></a></li> 	<li><a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-3987_en.htm"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window""><strong>Achieving global leadership in renewable energies</strong></a></li> 	<li><a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-3961_en.htm"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window""><strong>Providing a fair deal for consumers.</strong></a></li> </ol>
<p>The proposals put a welcome focus on energy demand, calling for all consumers to be involved – whether they are consumers of energy-related technologies or of energy. Whether the proposals are sufficient to significantly contribute to the EU meeting its Paris climate obligations is up to debate.</p>
<h3><strong>But there are clear, and somewhat puzzling, proposals for industry too.</strong></h3>
<p>The Communication includes an impact assessment for industry using policy scenarios to calculate that the proposals could achieve <strong>reductions in industry by 2030 ranging from 0.5% to 12%</strong>. But the savings are<strong> mainly driven by the EU Emissions Trading System and the impact of Ecodesign on the performance of industrial motors</strong>. In the more ambitious scenarios, there are also savings from horizontal measures and the application of best available technologies. The forecast improvements in energy intensity in industry are a minimal compared to the residential or services sectors.</p>
<p>This seems a rather partial assessment of the potential for energy savings in industry. The 2012 Energy Efficiency Directive emphasised mandatory audits for large industry, the promotion of energy efficiency in SMEs, and the promotion of energy management systems. Yet the recent Communication makes <strong>no mention of how those mandatory industry audits</strong> <strong>that have been completed can be used</strong> to undertake and track reductions in energy use and increases in energy efficiency.</p>
<p>The package makes no mention of the potential for using those audits to establish a database of potential savings. It does not discuss whether the Commission will help finance specific recommendations that flow from the audits. <strong>What will the Commission do to further support energy management systems such as ISO 50001</strong>? Such systems are crucial to change the culture within businesses as well as achieving real efficiency.</p>
<p>The Communication includes <strong>many proposals for facilitating actions related to industry, including initiatives to accelerate clean energy innovation, fostering competition, maximising Europe’s leadership in clean energy technologies and services</strong> to help third countries. Further, the Communication mentions spurring investment and technological leadership that will create new employment opportunities and enhance citizen welfare.</p>
<h3><strong>Degree of the Commission’s commitment to realising the potential of industrial energy efficiency</strong></h3>
<p>Yet the Communication itself casts some doubt on the degree of the Commission’s commitment to realising the potential of industrial energy efficiency. While the Communication says that EU industry must be at the forefront of the clean energy transition, it adds that the “Commission will support industry-led initiatives to promote EU global leadership in clean energy and low-carbon technological solutions.”</p>
<p>It does not seem highly ambitious for the Commission to wait for industry to lead, and to assign itself the reactive role of simply providing support. The more so, when in a discussion of energy intensive industries, the Communication urges further energy efficiency improvements and notes that “Such investments generally pay off in terms of reduced energy costs.” Really? Has the Commission not moved beyond the need to mention that energy efficiency is good for the bottom line.</p>
<p><strong>The publication of the Communication is the starting gun on negotiations to set a long-term policy framework for 2030</strong>. Policymakers, industry associations, environmental groups, consumer groups and others will now be dissecting it and suggesting changes, endorsing certain parts and helping <strong>to ensure that Europe does, indeed, set a framework for clean energy to contribute significantly to the Paris climate obligations</strong>.</p>
<p>So now is the chance to correct the weaknesses, through critical consultation.</p>

1056,"Five trends for Energy Efficiency in 2017",NULL,NULL,"<p>(from Steve Baab, DNV GL)</p>
<p>I think everyone will agree that 2016 was a year full of surprises and many people are looking forward to putting it behind us.&nbsp; However, 2016 was a good year for energy efficiency.&nbsp; There were major legislative initiatives, industry mergers, and many states “doubling-down” on energy efficiency to meet their energy needs.&nbsp; As we start a new year, I’ve captured the major trends in energy efficiency I see for 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Utilities embracing EE for the long haul</h3>
<p>Utilities in California, New York, Michigan, and Illinois have all committed to more funding for energy efficiency over the next 3-5 years and will be able to earn more financial rewards based on successful results. &nbsp;Oregon and Rhode Island committed to significantly increasing their Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) over the next 15-20 years.&nbsp; Funding and financing for energy efficiency projects also gained traction from legislation passed in California, Maine, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, and Virginia. &nbsp;With utilities taking a longer-term view of energy efficiency, many are now looking to integrate programs into core utility operations and improve <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://blogs.dnvgl.com/energy/how-the-drive-for-higher-jd-power-scores-can-hurt-energy-efficiency"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">customer satisfaction</a>.</p>
<h3>Increased regulatory scrutiny</h3>
<p>With more states beginning to follow California’s lead for increased funding for energy efficiency, state commissions are beginning to take a more active role in overseeing the administration of the funds.&nbsp; While it is difficult to argue with having more oversight for higher amounts of funding, the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://blogs.dnvgl.com/energy/achieving-big-savings-takeaways-from-aceees-recent-report"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">most cost effective energy efficiency</a> came from states where utilities were given the flexibility to administer programs. &nbsp;Utilities that have flexibility in administering programs can respond readily to both customer and market needs.</p>
<h3>Move from widgets to more complex measures</h3>
<p>Gone are the days where <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://blogs.dnvgl.com/energy/is-the-cfl-era-over-rapid-changes-in-the-residential-lighting-market"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">CFLs</a> made up the bulk of savings within an energy efficiency portfolio.&nbsp; Although lighting still is a great way to achieve savings, it has become much more complex.&nbsp; With LEDs, new fixture designs, and control systems, determining lighting savings takes more effort to calculate than just subtracting wattages and estimating run hours.&nbsp; In addition to lighting, many utilities are striving to achieve more savings from <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http:http://blogs.dnvgl.com/energy/were-hitting-program-savings-goals-now-what//"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">non-lighting technologies</a>.&nbsp; Some of the most popular measures for residential customers are WiFi thermostats and behavioral programs, while for business customers, variable speed drives, energy management systems, and process improvements are gaining traction.&nbsp; These types of measures are much more complex to evaluate savings than counting “widgets,” but can increase savings when simpler measures aren’t enough.</p>
<h3>Leveraging technology and AMI data</h3>
<p>Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) has opened new opportunities for energy usage data, and there seems to be some promise to leverage this data within <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://blogs.dnvgl.com/energy/how-does-more-accuracy-in-end-use-load-shapes-improve-impact-estimation-of-energy-efficiency-and-dr-programs"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">evaluation</a>.&nbsp; In addition, <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://blogs.dnvgl.com/energy/coming-home-part-6-the-future-role-of-utilities-in-home-energy-management-systems"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">home automation</a> and the internet of things (IoT) offer potential savings that were not achievable just five years ago.&nbsp; Advances in both the technology and automation are bringing new players into the energy efficiency space and new competitors to home automation.&nbsp; The only unknown is how fast customers will <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://blogs.dnvgl.com/energy/what-separates-consumer-perspectives-on-specific-smart-grid-enabled-services-and-technologies"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">adopt</a> these new technologies.</p>
<h3>Integration of DSM to Combine LR and EE</h3>
<p>When you talk to utility customers about saving energy, they will blend discussions about reducing peak load (load response – curtailment) with lighting retrofits (energy efficiency – EE).&nbsp; When you talk to a utility about Load Response and EE, you typically need to talk to two separate departments.&nbsp; &nbsp;But, for some utilities, this is beginning to change, due to the trends I discussed above.&nbsp; As generation plants are retired and replaced by renewables with a much different generation profile, capacity is becoming an issue and utilities are looking to solve these issues through EE.&nbsp; This is already happening in New York, where several EE programs were launched to address capacity shortfalls in specific locations.</p>
<p>I look forward to 2017 and see significant opportunities for energy efficiency.&nbsp; If these trends continue over the next several years, energy efficiency will grow and serve customers, vendors, and utilities well into the future.</p>

1057,"Standardisation, data and risk for energy efficiency investments",NULL,NULL,"<p>Good morning, today I am going to talk about three important words for the energy efficiency finance market, standardisation, data and risk.</p>

<p>I am going to start off talking about the so-called low-hanging fruit of energy efficiency, one of the most frequently used and&nbsp;<em>mis-used</em>&nbsp;phrases in energy efficiency. As some of you know I have been spending some time in Saudi Arabia in the last year and there are some very significant things happening in energy efficiency down there.&nbsp; This picture shows some low-hanging dates – by the way if you have not had fresh Saudi Arabian dates you need to try them, they are delicious – but anyway, we need to ban the phrase low-hanging fruit.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.onlyelevenpercent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Standardisation-blog-240117_1-e1485271051139.jpg""><img alt=""Standardisation blog 240117_1"" class=""wp-image-903 aligncenter"" height=""237"" src=""fileadmin/_processed_/9/f/csm_15a9cb3b2d_1a71c79fbe.jpg"" width=""355"" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""316"" style="""" /></a></p>

<p>This next slide shows that investing in energy efficiency is hard work, really hard work.&nbsp; This is the current situation.&nbsp; It is really hard to deploy capital into energy efficiency, deals take a long-time, deals fall apart after long development periods, and many funds have had trouble deploying capital – sometimes even having to return capital to investors because they cannot find viable deals.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.onlyelevenpercent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Standardisation-blog-240117_2-e1485271501292.jpg""><img alt=""Standardisation blog 240117_2"" class=""wp-image-900 aligncenter"" height=""222"" src=""fileadmin/_processed_/0/a/csm_a48cb208f5_e482ff1289.jpg"" width=""351"" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""317"" style="""" /></a></p>

<p>Where we need to get to is summed up in the next slide.&nbsp; We need to move towards large-scale, automated processes for investment – just like we have in other financial markets.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.onlyelevenpercent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Standardisation-blog-240117_3-e1485271747192.jpg""><img alt=""Standardisation blog 240117_3"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-901"" height=""293"" src=""fileadmin/_processed_/e/4/csm_8e2565a3d1_597661a3c5.jpg"" width=""350"" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""318"" style="""" /></a></p>

<p>I have talked many times before about the need for standardisation in energy efficiency.&nbsp; EEFIG said it was a major problem, Citi Bank have said it is a major problem, and other players like the IEA have agreed.&nbsp; In fact that need for standardisation was the genesis of the Investor Confidence Project.&nbsp; ICP standardises the development and documentation process for energy efficiency projects in buildings.&nbsp; I found another quote about standardisation that I like: “<em>Standards are like DNA.&nbsp; They are the basic building blocks for all technology and economic standards</em>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All financial markets are based on standards.&nbsp; The industrial revolution was based on standardisation.</p>

<p><strong>So what do we need to standardise?</strong>&nbsp; Firstly the <strong>development and documentation process</strong> for energy efficiency projects.&nbsp; This is what the Investor Confidence Project does.&nbsp; It now exists.&nbsp; It can be used in all countries in Europe and in the USA.&nbsp; Please use it.&nbsp; It works.</p>

<p>Secondly, we need to standardise the <strong>understanding of risks and value</strong>.&nbsp; This means counting all the sources of value created by energy efficiency projects and being very clear about all the risks.&nbsp; This is the subject of the Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group’s “Value and risk appraisal framework for energy efficiency finance and investments” which we are developing for EEFIG and which will be published in the summer.</p>

<p>Next we need to standardise <strong>contracts</strong>.&nbsp; A lot of work has been undertaken on this in the context of Energy Performance Contracts (EPCs).&nbsp; There are now several European standard contracts and guides for EPC.&nbsp; Of course, as I have said before, we need to develop other contract models that address the problems that EPCs don’t address.&nbsp; Standard contracts exist and can be used.</p>

<p>Finally we need to standardise <strong>performance data and reporting</strong>.&nbsp; We are now seeing a number of initiatives to do this including EEFIG’s DEEP.&nbsp; I encourage you to use DEEP and provide additional data for DEEP.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s look at the risks of energy efficiency</strong>. When I started in this business many years ago everyone said energy efficiency has no or low risk. Even now people say this.&nbsp; Here is a recent quote I found which will remain anonymous: “<em>The returns are tremendous, and there’s virtually no risk”</em>. &nbsp;&nbsp;This simply is not true.&nbsp; Here is some data from some US projects which show that energy efficiency projects using standard technologies rarely achieve what they are projected to.&nbsp; If you were an investor in these projects, whether you are a householder or a bank, you would not be very happy.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.onlyelevenpercent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Standardisation-blog-2401171-e1485329160308.jpg""><img alt=""Standardisation blog 240117"" class=""size-full wp-image-919 aligncenter"" height=""249"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/23622f225d.jpg"" width=""350"" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""319"" style="""" /></a></p>

<p>The EEFIG “<em>Value and risk appraisal framework for energy efficiency finance and investments</em>” is a guide to assessing value and risk and aims to provide a common language for project developers and financiers.&nbsp; As well as the document there will be a web based version which will allow anyone to access summary information, more details as well as specific process related resources and references.</p>

<p><strong>Now let’s look at data</strong>.&nbsp; Henry Ford launched the first mass-market car the Model T in 1908 and started to change the world.&nbsp; By 1919 car loans were developed and really opened up the market for cars.&nbsp; Therefore we have data on car loan performance for nearly a century.&nbsp; We have data on mortgages for even longer.&nbsp; However, there is still very little data on energy efficiency projects and how they perform.&nbsp; This is due to a number of reasons including:</p>

<ul> 	<li>Metering and measurement is difficult</li> 	<li>Measurement and Verification relatively new and still not widely used</li> 	<li>Contract forms like EPC mask performance risk</li> 	<li>Performance data considered proprietary.</li> </ul>

<p>Data sources are now emerging, or at least the first versions of data sources.&nbsp; The first is DEEP which I mentioned before.&nbsp; There is also Building Button which has been launched by the Investor Confidence Project.&nbsp; The Building Button allows project developers developing projects using the ICP protocols to push a button and start collecting real performance data in a standardised way.&nbsp; There is also The Curve.&nbsp; However, right now even these innovations still have very little real performance data.&nbsp; Collecting and making performance data available is a new concept and of course collecting time series data needs time. An essential part of any future data platform is a common, open source language like BEDES in the USA.&nbsp; Without that we cannot compare like with like, or build data platforms which enable anyone to build apps that mine data for their own specific purposes.&nbsp; The ICP Building Button is based upon BEDES.</p>

<p>So let’s pull together standardisation, data and risk.</p>

<p>First of all different sources of finance take different risks.&nbsp; There is equity which takes equity risks and debt which takes debt risks, and all the shades in-between.&nbsp; PACE financing in the US for example, is based on property tax which is senior to mortgages and is therefore very low risk.&nbsp; People have to pay their PACE repayment on their property taxes or the local government takes over their house.&nbsp; Energy Performance Contracts transfer performance risk to an ESCO but what is the price of transferring that risk?&nbsp; Often too high I think.</p>

<p>We need to move towards a world in which the risks are sliced up and transferred to the parties most willing and able to take those risks.&nbsp; The role of insurance is important here and we are seeing some insurance companies step up to take performance risk, a trend that will expand.&nbsp; Emerging business models like Managed Energy Service Agreements or Metered Energy Efficiency Transactions address risk in different ways.&nbsp; Finally of course, the ultimate source of low-cost capital, the debt capital markets, requires a lot of standardisation and data.</p>

<p>So to sum up, right now we are still in a world in which investing in energy efficiency is a niche activity and is really, really hard work.&nbsp; To move to a world in which it is mainstream and easy we need to make it like every other financial market.&nbsp; To move to that future we need standardisation, acknowledgement and understanding of risks, and data ….. data, data and data.</p>

1058,"Utilities large missed opportunity: Demand Response in manufacturing",NULL,NULL,"
<p>Demand Response (DR) helps utilities to manage the peak electricity demand by temporarily shifting the demand on the consumer side instead of building new power plants to meet the short-time peak demand. On the other hand, customers use demand response to reduce their electrical cost using the time-of-use price signals. Nowadays, work is underway to automate the process using automated demand response (AutoDR).</p>
<p>In this post I will not get into the details of DR or AutoDR and rather discuss the DR potential in the manufacturing sector. <strong>I believe one of the main barriers to DR in manufacturing is that the DR potential in this sector is not well understood by utilities, companies and other parties involved</strong>.</p>
<p>Based on my experience on energy efficiency and demand side management in industry in the past 10 years, for a <strong>manufacturing sector or process to have a great potential for Demand Response</strong> (DR), it <strong>should have one or more of the four characteristics</strong> shown in the figure below.</p>

<table style=""height:232px; width:474px""> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""> 			<p><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""203"" height=""224"" src=""fileadmin/_processed_/f/a/csm_heatpump_96b09543c7.png"" width=""335"" style="""" /></p> 			</th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p>Note: A bottleneck is a stage in a process that causes the entire process and the production rate of the final product to slow down.</p>
<p>Let me open this by giving a few examples below from an energy-intensive industry (cement industry) and a non-energy-intensive industry (textile industry).</p>

<h2>Example 1- DR potential in the cement industry:</h2>
<p>In a simple form, cement production process consists of raw material (mostly limestone) grinding, high temperature kiln for clinker making, and finish grinding of clinker and some additives into cement.</p>
<p>The electricity use in a cement plant ranges between 90 to 150 kWh/tonne cement depending on the grinding technology, raw material properties, etc. A cement plant may have a production capacity of less than 1000 tonne per day to more than 10,000 tonne per day. Therefore, the amount of electricity use by a cement plant can be quite substantial. Over 70% of the electricity use in cement plant is used in raw material grinding and finish grinding processes.</p>
<p>The <strong>raw material grinding process</strong> has the following <strong>three DR-friendly characteristics</strong>:</p>
<ol> 	<li>It is a batch process</li> 	<li>It has large storage capacity for its output (ground raw material) which last for hours and often for days</li> 	<li>The following process (which is kiln) can be considered a bottleneck of the production. This combined with large storage capacity before the bottleneck process (#2) provides a perfect condition for DR.</li> </ol>
<p>The <strong>finish grinding process</strong> has the following<strong> three DR-friendly characteristics</strong>:</p>
<ol> 	<li>It is a batch process</li> 	<li>There is a large storage capacity after kiln for ground clinker (and before finish grinding), which last for hours if not days.</li> 	<li>If production scheduling is flexible, the operation of finish grinding to produce the final cement product can be delayed for a few hours while the previous process can continue their operation.</li> </ol>
<p>If we assume that an exemplary cement plant uses 120 kWh/tonne cement of which 70% (84 kWh/tonne cement) used in raw material grinding and finish grinding, and produces 3000 tonne cement pre day (125 tonne/hour), every hour of shift in the operation of both raw material grinding and finish grinding in response to a DR signal will result in 125*84=10,500 kWh reduction in electricity demand.</p>
<p>This is roughly equal to average daily electricity consumption of 350 U.S. residential utility customers. If only the production of either raw material grinding or finish grinding is shifted, this reduction will be cut by almost half. This is such a large DR potential that I am going to hope all utilities and cement companies are taking advantage of it.</p>
<h2>Example 2- DR potential in the textile industry:</h2>
<p>There are many DR potential in the textile industry. I have done substantial work on this sector and can talk for hours on EE and DR potential in different textile subsectors and process. However, since this post is getting a bit longer than I planned, I will just briefly mention two DR potentials for this industry. If you like to know more, feel free to contact me.</p>
<p>The first example for the textile industry is in the yarn production process. One of the main process is called “spinning process” which uses different machines such as Ring frame, Open-end machines, etc. The <strong>spinning process</strong> has the following <strong>two DR-friendly characteristics</strong>:</p>
<ol> 	<li>It is a batch process</li> 	<li>It is a bottleneck process. Often, intermediary products that are fed into spinning machines get lined up for hours on the plant floor waiting to be processed by spinning machines. Having a proper storage capacity will allow to store enough feeding product for spinning machines and shut down the previous process, which account for around 30%-40% of electricity demand of the entire yarn production plants, for few hours during the DR period.</li> </ol>

<p>Another significant potential for DR in the textile industry is in <strong>wet-processing plants</strong>. Wet-processing plants conduct preparation, dyeing, printing, and/or finishing of yarn and fabric and other textile products. Many batch processes exist in wet-processing plants. Also, several processes like dryer, Stenter, or batch dyeing machines can be bottleneck processes that provide DR opportunity. Often wet-processing plants work on several different orders and products; thus, proper production scheduling can provide great DR opportunity. To take advantage of this, there needs to be high level of coordination between different departments within a plant who are in charge of production planning, energy management, paying utility bills, etc. Figure below illustrate the <strong>concept of DR potential in production processes with batch processing, storage capacity and a bottleneck process. </strong></p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""> 			<p><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""204"" height=""162"" src=""fileadmin/_processed_/e/6/csm_heatpimps_classification_8f0e938da5.png"" width=""309"" style="""" /></p> 			</th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p>To sum up, manufacturing sector is a complex and heterogeneous sector. Even within one industry subsector (for example, textile or food industry), there are completely different subsectors. However, there are great potentials for energy saving and Demand Response in the manufacturing sector. More in-depth understanding of production processes and technologies and energy systems in each manufacturing subsector will allow us to tap into these potential.&nbsp;Please feel free to contact me if you have any question.</p>

1059,"ISO 50001: easier Article 8 compliance, plus energy cost savings",NULL,NULL,"<h1>ISO 50001: easier Article 8 compliance, plus energy cost savings</h1>
<p>Right across Europe, Article 8 of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/EU (also known as ‘Article 8?) now applies. Simply put, from December 5th 2015, businesses with at least either 250 employees – or annual revenues of €50 million and an annual balance of €43 million – have had to comply with Article 8 in every EU Member State where such businesses have operations.</p>
<p>Old news to many, perhaps. But it’s news with a new twist, and one that will be especially interesting for many businesses.</p>
<p>Because a consensus is fast emerging around the view that ISO 50001 adoption is in fact a smarter, better way of achieving Article 8 compliance.</p>
<p>And, moreover, a way of achieving Article 8 compliance that – if implemented properly – is more likely to deliver on Article 8’s intended energy savings.</p>
<p>Certainly, here at DNV GL, we’ve seen a number of clients achieve genuine energy cost savings through ISO 50001 adoption. And savings that are definitely non-trivial. One client, a refinery, has so far logged energy cost savings of £5 million a year.</p>
<p><strong>What is ISO 50001?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s start at the beginning. Developed by the international organisation for standardisation ISO, in conjunction with national standards bodies,&nbsp;<em>ISO 50001:2011 Energy management systems</em>&nbsp;is an energy management standard.</p>
<p>Dating – as the name implies – from 2011, it is applicable for organisations large and small, in both public and private sectors, in manufacturing and services, in all regions of the world.</p>
<p>As such, its stated objective is to provide those organisations with management strategies to increase their energy efficiency, reduce their costs, and improve their energy performance, giving them a recognised framework for integrating energy performance into their management practices.</p>
<p>All of which is good news, of course.</p>
<p><strong>Goodbye, Article 8</strong></p>
<p>But from an Article 8 perspective, what is especially interesting is that ISO 50001 certification exempts businesses from the need to do a separate 4-yearly energy audit in order to comply with Article 8.</p>
<p>Put another way, adopt ISO 50001 (and have it certified) and there’s no need to worry about Article 8 compliance at all.</p>
<p>Now, there’s no doubt that some companies have approached ISO 50001 adoption as a ‘box ticking’ exercise, perhaps for reasons of corporate social responsibility, to burnish their green credentials with consumer activist groups, or take advantage of financial inducements.</p>
<p>That’s because in some countries, such as Austria, Germany, and France, ISO 50001 compliance has been incentivised through tax breaks. Of these, the French scheme is arguably the most interesting, as it has been brought into being just this year, reflecting the growing body of evidence that ISO 50001 really does help to deliver significant energy savings.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable savings</strong></p>
<p>That said, our view at DNV GL is that such inducements should not be the prime reason for working towards ISO 50001 status.</p>
<p>They’re a welcome bonus – the icing on the cake, as the saying goes – but they shouldn’t be the key driver.</p>
<p>And that’s because, when implemented properly, ISO 50001 has been shown to be capable of delivering energy savings of 5-10%, and sometimes greater.</p>
<p>It does this by re-shaping an organisation’s whole energy culture, changing the way that energy use is monitored, measured, and managed.</p>
<p>And it’s this approach to ISO 50001 adoption—focusing on the organisation’s energy culture, rather than viewing adoption as a box-ticking exercise—that is the approach to ISO 50001 implementation adopted by DNV GL.</p>

<p><strong><em>barrier of upgrading to efficient and dependable production equipment </em></strong></p>

<p>Production</p>
<p>at the New Center Stamping plant is highly dependent on access to a</p>
<p>reliable source of compressed air. Only a 25% reduction in available</p>
<p>pressure causes air – dependent machinery to automatically shut down. If</p>
<p>the air supply cannot be restored immediately, production ceases and</p>
<p>workers are sent home until it’s back up and running.</p>


<p>The</p>
<p>company’s existing compressed air system was a collection of equipment</p>
<p>from various decades. Some of the equipment dated as far back as the</p>
<p>1920’s when the building – made famous in the movie <a href=""http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/e/8_Mile.html#.WIDHBLGZNsM"" target=""_blank"">8 Mile</a></p>
<p>– was constructed. One piece of equipment, still in use far beyond its</p>
<p>expected lifespan, had been manufactured by a company long since out of</p>
<p>business. When it – a production critical unit – broke down, replacement</p>
<p>parts were no longer available to make the necessary repairs.</p>

<p>After a replacement unit was priced at more than $150,000, a system – wide upgrade was discussed.</p>

<p>The</p>
<p>Energy Alliance Group of Michigan (EAG) was tasked with developing a</p>
<p>comprehensive replacement for New Center’s piecemeal and outdated</p>
<p>compressed air system. EAG teamed up with one of our alliance partners,</p>
<p>Air Technologies. After an extensive “air audit,” the quantity of air needed for full production was calculated. Based on that number, a customized, self contained compressed air “plant” – a unique solution known as <a href=""http://www.aircompressors.com/utility-services/directair/"" target=""_blank""><strong>Direct</strong><strong><em>AIR</em></strong>®</a> – was created.</p>
<p>Installed adjacent to the factory, once electrical power,&nbsp;a heat exchanger and air delivery lines were connected&nbsp;to the “plant”, a completely upgraded, high – tech source&nbsp;of compressed air was online and fully operational. The&nbsp;previous</p>
<p>“system” would no longer interfere with production. And, New Center</p>
<p>Stamping only pays for the quantity of compressed air actually used!</p>


<p>The New</p>
<p>Center staff was happy to note the solution included a variety of</p>
<p>unexpected benefits beyond maintaining reliable production:</p>

<ul> 	<li><strong>Dramatic noise reduction</strong> – with the compressors now housed in a separate structure outside the building, the noise level within the building dropped dramatically.</li> 	<li><strong>Air consumption computer controlled</strong> – less waste and a significant reduction in electrical use due to computer monitored air production resulting in optimum air volume with no excess.</li> 	<li><strong>Improved space utilization</strong> – the former compressed air equipment will be removed and the now free space will be converted into a new storage area.</li> 	<li><strong>Zero down time</strong> – all maintenance and repairs of the <strong>Direct</strong><strong><em>AIR</em></strong>® equipment are included with the service and the equipment is constantly monitored offsite. Automated system alerts provide <strong>Direct</strong><strong><em>AIR</em></strong>® service technicians with the spontaneous information they need that allows them to show up for service before the New Center staff is even aware a problem is developing. Backup systems are also contained in the unit to guarantee zero downtime.</li> </ul>
<h4><strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>DirectAIR® allows us to guarantee the quantity of air, operating pressure and absence of moisture – 24/7 – with ZERO downtime. No more nuisance calls, waiting for parts or waiting for service.”</em></strong> Darryl Kukla, Air Technologies</h4>



<p>The <strong>Direct</strong><strong><em>AIR</em></strong>®</p>
<p>solution was installed without any capital outlay and, coupled with</p>
<p>several other upgrades within the plant, resulted in a significant</p>
<p>utility rebate as well as being eligible for Michigan Saves financing.</p>
<p>The company expects to reduce maintenance costs, lower their energy</p>
<p>bill, improve the work environment and reduce production down time by at</p>
<p>least 1000 minutes per year – &nbsp;on just one of their production lines.</p>


<p>When production is as dependent on</p>
<p>reliable compressed air as most companies are on electricity, it’s easy</p>
<p>to understand why affordable upgrades of outdated equipment is not an</p>
<p>option – &nbsp;but a revenue protecting – necessity.</p>

1062,"Where is industry in addressing Europe’s climate and energy obligations?",NULL,NULL,"<h3>Where is industry in addressing Europe’s climate and energy obligations? &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Last November, the European Commission published its proposals to revise its array of clean energy legislation to have them more fit for purpose to help Europe meet its obligations under the Paris climate agreement. Informally, the proposals are known as the “Winter Package.” Importantly, it proposed a new energy saving target for 2030 – 30%, up from 27% and now binding instead of indicative. The package is now going through the approval process within the European Parliament and the European Council (ministers from member states). &nbsp;</p>
<p>The package has three main goals:</p>
<ol> 	<li>putting energy efficiency first,</li> 	<li>achieving global leadership in renewable energies, and</li> 	<li>providing a fair deal for consumers.</li> </ol>
<p>The facilitating actions includes, among others,</p>
<ul> 	<li>initiatives to accelerate clean energy innovation,</li> 	<li>the promotion of industry-led initiatives to foster competitiveness, and</li> 	<li>maximise Europe’s leadership in clean energy technology and services to help third countries achieve their policy goals. &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p>There is one piece of legislation, the <strong>2012 Energy Efficiency Directive</strong>, which has had elements directly dealing with the <strong>industrial sector</strong>.</p>
<p>First, there was the requirement for <strong>large industry to have a mandatory audit</strong> by the end of 2016 and then to have them on a regular basis. The definition was loosely defined and to its credit, Italy included small and medium-sized enterprises that were large energy consumers.</p>
<p>The EED also pushed for greater <strong>promotion of energy management systems, such as ISO 50001</strong> and for greater help for SMEs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For whatever reason, and it is not obvious, there were no new legislative proposals for industry. The impact assessment that supported the proposals showed that the reductions in industry by 2030 range from 0.5% to 12% compared to the baseline. Interestingly, the expected savings are mainly driven by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and the impact of Ecodesign on the performance of industrial motors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is strange since there is widespread agreement that, for whatever overall impact ETS has had, it definitely has not encouraged industry to improve its energy efficiency. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There is one major problem</strong>. The Commission has limited the number of articles of the Directive that will be revised. Only it can agree to opening up any other article and they are showing no sign of willingness to do so. That does not mean that representatives from industry should not raise their voice. It does mean that the results may not come quickly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On a <strong>more positive</strong> note, there are some non-legislative initiatives that could be good for industry.&nbsp; Let’s discuss but two.</p>
<h3>The Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG)</h3>
<p>The Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG) was set up by the Commission and the United Nations Environment Programme – Financial Initiative a few years ago.&nbsp; EEIP is a member. While it initially provided recommendations to the Commission and to the financial sector how to improve the flow of financing to industry and buildings, it is starting to take other actions.&nbsp; A database is being created that will help up-scale energy efficiency investments in Europe. Called DEEP – <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://deep.eefig.eu/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">De-risking Energy Efficiency Platform</a> – it is an open-source initiative through the improved sharing and transparent analysis of existing projects in buildings and Industry. Recently launched, the database now includes more than 7,000 projects. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now EEFIG will be deciding soon what further steps will be taken. It is hoped it will include a more formalised forum for stakeholders to discuss how the financial sector can play a more pro-active and effective role in ensuring sufficient financing is available. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Industry, Infrastructure &amp; Investor Confidence Project Europe (I3CP)</h3>
<p>Linked to that is a new project funded by the European Commission.&nbsp; Known as Industry, Infrastructure &amp; Investor Confidence Project Europe (I3CP) to accelerate a global asset class for energy efficiency investment in industry and infrastructure by standardizing projects, from initial design through measurement and verification. This will help improve the entire project process, giving investors more confidence in the expected impact. The project is just getting underway and EEIP is a member of the project consortium. We will ensure readers are kept up to date with progress.

<p><strong>Where are we now? </strong></p>
<p>Industry is one of the major drivers of Europe’s economy. It must remain competitive and innovative. Improving how it uses energy is fundamental as new technologies and techniques are coming to market all the time. It is important for the European Union to give the right signals that it will do all possible to help its industrial sector maintain its competitive edge. Unfortunately, the Winter Package fails to do so. Let’s hope that changes as there is increased awareness that industry should not be neglected.</p>

1064,"Utility of the future",NULL,NULL,"
<p>Energy Efficiency in industrial processes is part of the Demand Side Management of the energy markets. However, there are many developments clearly indicating that the time is over where the different parts of the energy market can just be looked at seperately. This even includes the supply side. Industrial energy use is connected to themes like smart cities and electric mobility on the on hand and e.g. Demand Response topics on the other hand.</p>
<p>Accordingh to the MITEI, the Utility of the Future study is the first of a new series of reports that is being produced by the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI) to serve as balanced, fact-based, and analysis-driven guides to key topic areas in energy fora wide range of decision makers in government and industry. This study specifically aims to serve as a guide for policy makers, regulators, utilities, existing and startup energy companies, and other power-sector stakeholders to better understand the factors that are currently driving change in power systems worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the executive summary, the starting point is described as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Important changes in the provision and consumption of electricity services</strong> are now underway, driven to a significant degree by a confluence of factors affecting the distribution side of power systems. A variety of emerging distributed technologies — including <strong>flexible demand, distributed generation, energy storage, and advanced power electronics and control devices</strong> — are creating new options for the provision and consumption of electricity services. At the same time, <strong>information and communications technologies</strong> are rapidly decreasing in cost and becoming ubiquitous, enabling more flexible and efficient consumption of electricity, improved visibility of network use, and enhanced control of power systems.</p>

<p>There are <strong>6 core findings</strong> highlighted</p>

<ol> 	<li>The only way to put all resources on a level playing field and achieve efficient operation and planning in the power system is to dramatically <strong>improve prices and regulated charges</strong> (i.e., tariffs or rates for electricity services.</li> 	<li>The <strong>regulation of distribution utilities</strong> must be improved to enable the development of more efficient distribution utility business models.</li> 	<li>The <strong>structure of the electricity industry</strong> should be carefully reevaluated to minimize potential conflicts of interest.</li> 	<li><strong>Wholesale market design</strong> should be improved to better integrate distributed resources, reward greater flexibility, and create a level playing field for all technologies.</li> 	<li>Widespread connection of distributed energy resources and smart appliances and development of more complex electricity markets increase the importance of <strong>cybersecurity</strong> and heighten privacy concerns.</li> 	<li>Better <strong>utilization of existing assets and smarter energy consumption</strong> hold great potential for cost savings. At the same time, economies of scale still matter, and the distributed deployment of solar PV or energy storage is not cost-effective in all contexts and locations.</li> </ol>

1065,"The key to scaling up energy efficiency – new business models and structures",NULL,NULL,"<p>The level of investment in energy efficiency required to meet climate and energy security targets is significantly higher than both the current levels, and the levels that can be financed by public capital.&nbsp; In order <strong>to scale up energy efficiency</strong> to the levels that we know are possible, and we know are needed, we <strong>need to change the game</strong> and make energy efficiency into something that people want to buy, and something that can be easily financed by institutional capital at scale.</p>
<p><strong>The barriers to scaling up investment into energy efficiency are now well documented</strong>.&nbsp; To name just a few: projects are small, the methods of developing and documenting project development are not standardised, capacity within the financial sector to understand value and risks of energy efficiency is limited, and traditional business models such as Energy Performance Contracts are not attractive in many segments of the market. As Michael Eckhart of Citi said; “energy efficiency does not meet the needs of the capital markets”. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are signs, however, that the foundations of a functioning energy efficiency financing market are now being put in place. &nbsp;The <strong>Investor Confidence Project </strong>is rolling out its Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™&nbsp;project certification system in the US and Europe, with growing interest from India, China and Australia and New Zealand.&nbsp; The <strong>EU’s Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (EEGIG)</strong> is soon to launch its “Value and risk appraisal framework for energy efficiency finance and investments”, a guide to under-writing energy efficiency projects in buildings and industry. Investors and lenders are expressing more interest in developing energy efficiency related products. In the <strong>US Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE)</strong> continues to grow and PACE loans are now regularly being securitised. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To build upon these foundations we need to ensure that four components are brought together in the same place at the same time by entrepreneurial individuals and organisations.&nbsp; The <strong>four components</strong> are</p>
<ol> 	<li><strong>finance</strong> (for projects and development),&nbsp;</li> 	<li><strong>standardisation</strong>,</li> 	<li><strong>large-scale pipelines</strong>, and</li> 	<li><strong>capacity building</strong> on the demand side, the supply side and within the financial sector.&nbsp;</li> </ol>
<p>Project finance is abundantly available and much of it is seeking environmentally conscious or green homes – the issue right now is a lack of projects.&nbsp; Many failed energy efficiency finance schemes prove that project finance alone is not enough. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There is a need to finance the development of projects, that risky stage between “here is a good project idea” and “here is a fully developed bankable project”</strong>.&nbsp; Development capital is always high risk and there is an argument for using public capital to support this stage, although of course this does not generally happen in other sectors like property or power generation so it is questionable why it should in energy efficiency.&nbsp; The efficiency sector generally lacks a development mentality and eco-system and so public capital could be used to kick-start the development market using low cost convertible loans or grants such as the EU’s Project Development Assistance. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Standardisation in the development and documentation of projects is now available through the Investor Confidence Project</strong>.&nbsp; Currently available for buildings in the US, Canada and across all countries of Europe, the Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™&nbsp;project certification system is there to be used.&nbsp; As it brings reduced due diligence costs and greater certainty of outcome, project developers, clients and financiers will increasingly require its use. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There is a lack of large-scale pipelines that can attract institutional capital</strong>. Energy efficiency projects tend to be developed on a building by building or site by site basis rather than across portfolios.&nbsp; In the 1980s and early 1990s large scale energy management programmes were implemented across many public and private sector portfolios but that skill and activity seems to have been lost. We are still in the pilot project mentality all too often. To develop large pipelines requires several things.&nbsp;</p>

<ol> 	<li>Firstly it needs entrepreneurial efforts to acquire and build pipelines.&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Secondly, it needs attractive and simple business models that really make sense for clients.&nbsp; Existing models such as Energy Performance Contracts do not make sense for large parts of the market. Emerging models such as Efficiency Services Agreements, metered efficiency and Pay for Performance are more attractive and need to be developed and deployed.&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Finally, it needs strong leadership from client organisations and those that convene portfolio holders such as central, city and local governments to demand effective action at scale. &nbsp;</li> </ol>
<p><strong>Capacity building</strong> amongst clients – the demand side – needs to focus on the energy and non-energy benefits of improved energy efficiency and the availability of financed solutions.&nbsp; Non-energy benefits such as increased asset value or improved health and well-being need to be stressed above just energy costs savings as they are usually much more interesting and strategic to most organisations.&nbsp; On the supply side capacity building needs to focus on developing standardised and bankable projects with consistent results.&nbsp; Within the financial industry capacity building needs to be focused on understanding the nature of efficiency, understanding the sources of value and the risks, as well as on the different ways that energy efficiency can be made into a financeable asset – all subjects covered in the EEFIG under-writing guide. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Pulling these four components together requires entrepreneurial effort – effort that can come from the public and/or private sectors – and can manifest itself in different organisational forms.&nbsp; Successful organisational forms include, but are not limited to, procurement frameworks, super ESCOs and retrofit accelerators.&nbsp; Successful procurement frameworks that can be used as models include the UK’s Carbon and Energy Fund which develops and helps finance large scale projects within the National Health Service. Through its framework it delivers finance, the pipeline, capacity building and standardisation (based on the Investor Confidence Project’s system).&nbsp; In the US there are several retrofit accelerators which bring together the different elements.&nbsp; In Dubai and India there are Super-ESCos, Etihad in Dubai and EESL in India.&nbsp; Both have successfully brought the four components together to deliver large-scale energy efficiency programmes and are good models for Europe and the US. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Massively scaling up investment into energy efficiency remains one of the biggest financial opportunities</strong> on the planet as well as the best opportunity to improve environmental conditions and reduce the threat from climate change.&nbsp; <strong>Even at current low energy prices the world spends some USD 5-6 trillion a year on energy</strong>. Entrepreneurs need to work to deliver new localised and national organisational forms that bring together the four components and deliver investment projects that significantly reduce energy spend, and bring multiple other benefits.</p>

1066,"Why Germany needs a European Energiewende",NULL,NULL,"<h2>Why Germany needs a European Energiewende</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;European Union is&nbsp;currently negotiating&nbsp;its 2030 energy goals. So far, the German Energiewende has been criticized for being too inward-looking. Yet it is in Germany’s immediate interest to embrace the European dimension. <strong>Rebecca Bertram&nbsp;looks at why Germany needs a European&nbsp;Energiewende</strong>.</p>
<p>The origin of the German&nbsp;Energiewende&nbsp;is purely national. Indeed, when the German federal government decided to embark on the restructuring of Germany’s energy system, it did so without regard for the impact the transition would have on its European neighbors. As a result, the German&nbsp;Energiewende&nbsp;is not always appreciated in Europe to the extent that German policy-makers would like it to be.</p>
<h3><strong>Europe provides the German&nbsp;<em>Energiewende</em>&nbsp;with flexibility</strong></h3>
<p>As renewables now make up 32 percent of total electricity generation, the German&nbsp;Energiewende&nbsp;is entering a decisive second phase. In an energy system in which volatile and not always readily available renewable energies comprise the largest share of production, the challenge is increasingly that of efficiently reconciling supply and demand.</p>
<p>In recent years, Germany has benefited significantly from the integrated European power grid. For example, it has fed surplus wind power from northern Germany into the power grids of its neighbors, or has used their grids to transport electricity from northern Germany to industry hubs in the south of Germany. Whenever Germany was at a low point in its own power generation, it was able to obtain conventional electricity from its neighbors. However, these practices and actions have resulted in considerable unpredictability in the national power grids of the other European countries. Poland, in particular, has objected time and again that this situation is forcing its energy suppliers to adapt their net transmission capacities accordingly.</p>
<p>For Germany, this state of affairs was and is convenient for two main reasons.</p>
<ul> 	<li>Firstly, it has allowed Germany to export its surplus electricity—at present about 8 percent of its annual electricity consumption—to other European countries.</li> 	<li>Secondly, it has spared Germany of the costly task of having to build its own flexible electricity infrastructure with large storage capacities and new transmission lines.</li> </ul>
<p>Germany’s neighbors, however, unhappy with these parallel and loop flows, have reciprocated by gradually increasing the use of so-called&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL5N17G3OC"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">phase-shifters</a>&nbsp;along the borders to Germany to minimize the exploitation of their national power grids. For Germany’s&nbsp;Energiewende, this represents a crucial loss, insofar as the former modus operandi not only allowed for flexibility but also kept the cost of the&nbsp;Energiewende&nbsp;lower than it would otherwise have been without access to the power lines and power markets of its neighbors.</p>
<h3>The German&nbsp;<em>Energiewende</em>&nbsp;will only succeed if&nbsp;adopted across Europe</h3>
<p>According to the European Commission’s energy vision for 2030, Europe is to meet 27 percent of its total energy demand with renewable energy, and increase its energy efficiency by 30 percent. In addition, certain capacity mechanisms are to favor the construction of new conventional power plants.</p>
<p>These objectives show above all that the European member states currently are not united in following a greater shared energy vision. Instead, each country continues to pursue purely national energy interests—from coal in Poland to nuclear in France. In light of these differences, it is not surprising that the European Commission does not propose any more ambitious legislation. A change here will only come about if&nbsp;Energiewende&nbsp;pioneers, such as Germany, convince their European neighbors of the economic and security benefits that a restructuring of the energy system entails.</p>
<p>To be clear, this would be in Germany’s own interest, namely because Germany needs Europe to drive its own&nbsp;Energiewende&nbsp;forward. The European Commission has the power to considerably slow down Germany’s Energiewende in the years to come. For example, the Commission is threatening an end to Germany’s priority access to the grid rule for renewables. A European&nbsp;Energiewende&nbsp;is likewise needed to achieve the climate goals, which Germany and the European Union signed up to as part of the Paris Climate Agreement at the end of 2015. Last but not least, the German&nbsp;Energiewende&nbsp;alone—provided that it finally leads to the much needed GHG emissions reductions—still cannot bring about the necessary turnaround in global climate change.</p>
<h3>Europe in a crisis needs an energy vision</h3>
<p>Europe is currently facing a serious identity crisis. Following Brexit and given the numerous anti-European movements in many EU member states, Europe needs a unifying growth and innovation vision able to attract major investments in an overarching European project.</p>
<p>A European&nbsp;Energiewende&nbsp;could be this vision for Europe. It would not only foster and strengthen a culture of innovation and digitization but also serve to highlight Europe’s role as a global pioneer in sustainable energy policy and increase the international competitiveness of both Germany and Europe.</p>
<p>Finally, a European&nbsp;Energiewende&nbsp;would benefit the energy security of Germany and the entire European Union, because locally produced electricity combined with increasing energy efficiency decreases dependency on imports and international price developments. In recent years, the alarming impact of energy insecurity for Europe was distinctly felt with the Russia-Ukraine gas disputes, which served as a painful reminder that the European Union today imports around one third of its natural gas from Russia. If the European Union is serious about its Energy Union mission, it should directly tie this in with discussions about a European&nbsp;Energiewende. Such a vision would turn the crisis into a chance for Europe to improve both its negotiating power vis-à-vis Russia, and its status as an international leader in modern and sustainable energy infrastructure.</p>
<h3><strong>What next?</strong></h3>
<p>Therefore, if Germany is to make a meaningful contribution to the energy policy debate in Europe over the next two years, Berlin should not limit itself to petty disputes over the priority grid access for renewables or capacity mechanisms. Rather, Germany should, together with its European neighbors, develop a new narrative about a common European&nbsp;Energiewende&nbsp;– one that addresses the concerns of other European member states as well. This dialogue should focus on Europe’s advantages of economic modernization and international competition. Only then can the&nbsp;Energiewende&nbsp;succeed in both Germany&nbsp;and&nbsp;Europe.&nbsp;</p>

1067,"Whirlwind: Approval process European Commission´s clean energy package",NULL,NULL,"<h2>The Brussels Winter Package&nbsp;whirlwind</h2>
<p>The European Commission’s clean energy – or ‘winter’ – package is producing a whirlwind of activity in its approval process. I have seen it at first hand over the past few weeks, at meetings, workshops and conferences reviewing impact assessments, addressing energy efficiency financing, and discussing the central role of consumers in the winter package. It was enough to compete with even the Brussels obsession with Brexit.</p>
<p>There are some critical issues related to the approval process of the package.</p>
<p><strong>The Target</strong>: There is divergence on the target. From the current 27% non-binding target, the Commission proposed a more rigorous binding target of 30% savings by 2030. While the European Parliament supports that kind of target, it appears that Council (representing member states) is much less ambitious. From recent evidence, such as impact assessments reviewed at a workshop organised by&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.leonardo-energy.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Leonardo Energy</a>, it seems that an ambitious target is needed. But whatever the target, my concern is the part that energy efficiency will be assigned in achieving it. Hopefully there is a growing appreciation of the critical contribution that improved energy efficiency can make to the EU’s obligations under the 2015 Paris climate agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency First</strong>: The discussion of targets, and how to meet them, should refer back to the Energy Union’s commitment to Efficiency First, which essentially set energy efficiency as the first filter for all energy policies. “It prioritises investments in customer-side efficiency resources (including end-use energy efficiency and demand response) whenever they would cost less, or deliver more value, than investing in energy infrastructure, fuels, and supply alone,” according to the&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.raponline.org/efficiency-first-principle-practice/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Regulatory Assistance Project</a>&nbsp;(RAP).</p>
<p>I would like to be reassured that the other directives under review (renewables, governance and internal market for electricity) as well as accompanying initiatives, have been developed under the Efficiency First principle. I hope so, but am sceptical at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>On the industry side</strong>, the main driver for energy efficiency is considered to be the EU’s Emissions Trading System. But, according to recent analyses discussed in Brussels, the ETS is not actually delivering energy efficiency. Yet the winter package offers basically no energy efficiency proposals for industry. There appears to be a gap.</p>
<p><strong>Renovation of buildings</strong>: The factsheets that accompanied the winter package said that “The changes proposed by the Commission in the Energy Efficiency Directive and the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive aim to speed up the renovation rate of existing buildings with a view to decarbonising the building stock by mid-century.” It is not obvious how this is going to happen. While initiatives such as Smart Financing for Smart Buildings are welcome, they do not appear to be accelerating deep renovations on the scale needed. As the&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://energyindemand.com/energy-advice-exchange/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Energy Advice Exchange</a>&nbsp;(EAE) has argued, without effective energy advice, consumers are not going to undertake significant energy efficiency renovations. Member States are required to prepare renovation strategies (first under the Energy Efficiency Directive and now proposed to be under the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive) but there is no requirement to implement the strategies. A recent review by the EAE showed that many (if not most) Member States did not even use those strategies as consultation documents in discussions with national stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>A consumer-centred clean energy package</strong>: Every page of the winter package has a focus on consumer needs. This is most welcome and long overdue. A recent conference organised by BEUC, the European Consumer Organisation, discussed the clean energy package from the point of view of smart meters, allowing consumers to switch providers, bundling issues, and consumer protection. While those measures are certainly all important, there was no discussion of the role of consumers in renovation strategies (although it was finally brought up). Financing packages and an energy performance certificate from the EPBD, while useful, will not be enough to encourage consumers to invest in ambitious energy-saving renovations. A winter package that puts the consumer first will have to provide much more help and encouragement for the consumer if significant energy savings are to be achieved.</p>
<p><strong>The process</strong>: It was frustrating that in the EED and EPBD, so few articles were opened for revision. This hardly makes sense if first principles – Efficiency First – are being implemented and when energy efficiency is on the verge of finally playing the role it should in our carbon mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>Council and Parliament have a major job ahead to review and reflect on the analysis from the impact assessments, and on the proposals for revising the directives. The advocacy community (professional lobbyists and environmental groups) also must come to grips with the full range of themes and proposals raised by the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission is to be commended for the package. This holistic, integrated approach has never happened before. It is an excellent basis to build on.</p>
<p>Now is the opportunity to make Efficiency First through making Consumers First. It is the opportunity for improved energy efficiency to be positioned at the centre of post-Paris low-carbon mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>This is a process that should involve people well beyond Brussels, across Europe. This is laying a foundation –THE foundation – for our low-carbon energy transition that will resonate for many years to come. We do not get many opportunities to take such momentous steps. It deserves all positive criticism that will contribute to a stronger, more effective winter package.</p>

1068,"Energy audit in SMEs could unlock great energy efficiency potential in Europe: a focus on the Italian model.",NULL,NULL,"<p>Energy audits play an essential role in the achievement of energy savings at the European level. They are an effective tool to providing the necessary information on the existing energy consumption and the opportunities to save energy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The ‘energy audit’ tool, first introduced by The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) following the 1973 oil crisis, became popular in Europe since the early 1990s. It was present in Article 7 of the Council Directive 93/76/EEC, in Article 12 of the Directive 2006/32/EC, and in Article 8 of the current Directive 2012/27/EU, also known as Energy Efficiency Directive (EED). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Article 2 (25) of the EED defines ‘energy audit’ as follows: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“Energy Audit means a systematic procedure with the purpose of obtaining adequate knowledge of the existing energy consumption profile of a building or group of buildings, an industrial or commercial operation or installation or a private or public service, identifying and quantifying cost-effective energy savings opportunities, and reporting the findings;” &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The EED Directive strengthens the energy audit obligations for the Member States. In particular, Article 8(4) of the Directive makes energy audits mandatory for large enterprises. Yet, the Directive does not require large enterprises to actually implement any audit recommendations. Furthermore, while Article 8(2) put a strong emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and advises “<em>Member States to develop programmes to encourage SMEs to undergo energy audits and the subsequent implementation of the recommendations from these audits</em>”, it does not set any mandatory energy audits requirements for SMEs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the implementation of the EED Directive, we are now discovering best practices set out by some Member States that go beyond the EED provisions and could be an example for the rest of Europe. According to a recent study on energy efficiency in enterprises carried out by the European Commission[i], countries such as Italy, Portugal, Belgium (Flanders) and Romania, do have mandatory requirements for the implementations of the measures identified in the energy audit, although applicable only to energy-intensive companies. As the definition of SMEs in Article 2(26) of the EED does not refer to energy intensity or to energy consumption, an energy consuming company can also be an SME. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This post focuses on the model developed in Italy, which include two level of innovation: ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol> 	<li>SMEs to undergo energy audits if energy consuming companies;</li> 	<li>Mandatory implementation of the identified measures by energy consuming companies. &nbsp;</li> </ol>
<h3>The Italian model &nbsp;</h3>
<p>In Italy the EED has been ratified with the Legislative Decree n.102 of 04/07/2014 (Legislative Decree 102/2014), which <strong>obliges large companies and energy consuming companies to perform an energy audit</strong> by 5 December 2015, and at least every four years. Certified companies with ISO 50001, EN ISO 14001 and EMAS are exempt to this obligation if the system include an energy audit in accordance with annex II of the Legislative Decree. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Decree also states that energy consuming companies, not only have to undergo the energy audit, but they also have to<strong> implement the identified efficiency measures under reasonable time</strong>, or in alternative, adopt a management system in compliance with ISO 50001 standards. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Definitions &nbsp;</h3>
<p>An organization qualifies as large enterprises if it employs more than 250 people, with an annual turnover greater than 50 million euros or an annual balance sheet of more than 43 million euros. &nbsp;</p>
<p>An energy consuming company qualifies if:</p>
<ul> 	<li>It use more than 2,4 GWh of electric energy or energy different than electricity;</li> 	<li>The ratio of energy cost and turnover of more or equal to 3%. &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<h3>Number of enterprises obliged to undergo energy audits &nbsp;</h3>

<p>According to the “Structure and competitiveness of enterprises” report from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), in Italy <strong>large enterprises are about 3 500, while there are about 4.3 millions of SMEs on the territory</strong>. The following figure, illustrate the main indicators for industrial and services enterprises in Italy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>By including energy intensive enterprises, the Legislative Decree extends the obligation to enterprises regardless of the size. The total energy intensive enterprises amounted at 2 772[i] as of 2014, and 2 929 as of 2015. These companies have a tax relief on the electric bill’s energy cost. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Guarantee of high-quality audits &nbsp;</h3>
<p>From July 20, 2016, energy audits can only be carried out by entities or qualified experts certified by accredited bodies (ESCOs under UNI CEI 11352, EGE under UNI CEI 11339, Energy auditor under UNI 16247 – 5)[ii]. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Sanctions &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Obliged enterprises that fail to deliver energy audits within the deadline can be subject to an administrative penalty up to EUR 40 000. Moreover, if the audit is not compliant with the audit requirements set out in the Decree, an administrative penalty up to EUR 20 000 can be applied. The penalty does not free the enterprise from the energy audit, which must be submitted to ENEA within six months after the imposition of the sanction. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>The role of ENEA to ensure the effectiveness of the provisions &nbsp;</h3>
<p>ENEA is the acronym for the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy, and Sustainable Economic Development. The agency manages a database of enterprises obliged to undergo energy audits, carry out controls to ensure compliance with the audit requirements through an annual random selection of the enterprises subject to the obligation (at least 3%). The control activities also include in “situ” inspections. As from June 2016, ENEA writes an annual summary report of the audit activities and results. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Results &nbsp;</h3>
<p>According to ENEA, the following results were delivered under article 8 of the Legislative Decree 102/2014 and are summarized as follows: &nbsp;</p>
<ol> 	<li>14 342 audits from 7 516 companies were sent by December 2015, increasing to 8 461 with 15 685 audits by the end of June 2016.[iii]</li> 	<li>In 2015, approximately 63% of energy audits were made by large enterprises, while approximately 37% by energy intensive enterprises.</li> 	<li>95% of the energy intensive enterprises fulfilled the energy audit legal requirements. ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>The majority of energy audits in 2015 were made by the manufacturing sector (approximately 47%), followed by wholesale and retail trade (16.3%).</li> 	<li>As of 2015, certified enterprises according to ISO 50001 standards were 450, and enterprises with an energy manager and at the same time ISO 50001 certified were 115 (51 in the industrial sector, 32 in the energy and network services sector).</li> 	<li>About 700 penalties on defaulting enterprises were imposed after the control activities carried out by the Ministry of Economic Development (125 or around 20% on energy intensive enterprises). &nbsp;</li> </ol>

<h3>The focus on SMEs and the regional leadership &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Italy focused on energy savings in the industrial sector and the SMEs since the 1990s. In particular, European funds were used to carry out an energy audit campaign in central and southern Italy in the years 1989-1991, covering more than 500 SMEs from different sectors and identified energy saving measures for about 260 ktoe.</p>




<p>The Decree of 12 May 2015, as foreseen in Article 8 (9) of the Legislative Decree 102/2014, allocated <strong>EUR 15 millions a year until 2020, to co-finance regional programmes aiming at delivering energy audits for the SMEs</strong>, or for the adoption by the SMEs of an energy management system in compliance with ISO 50001 standards. <strong>Beneficiaries of the incentive have to realise the identified energy efficiency measures </strong>or obtain the ISO 50001 certification. The 2014 Italian Energy Efficiency Action Plan (EEAP) estimates <em>in the event that 50% of the costs incurred by the Regions are co-financed to grant a subsidy of 50% of the expenditure incurred by SMEs to carry out the energy audit, <strong>about 15 000 enterprises per year could be covered by the initiative. &nbsp; </strong></em></p>
<p>The Lombardy region in Northern Italy carried out an innovative programme, named TREND (Technology and Innovation for Energy Saving and Widespread Energy Efficiency)[i], aiming at promoting and delivering high quality energy audits and associated energy efficiency measures to SMEs in the manufacturing sector in the region. The following scheme summarises the TREND programme’s phases. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Figure 3 TREND programme in Lombardy region &nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the 2014 Italian Energy Efficiency Action Plan, 500 SMEs received energy audits and 150 energy efficiency projects were planned (90 completed). The programme, which is still undergoing, produced energy efficiency actions in the amount of EUR 8.5 million and led to energy savings for around 4 000 toe. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Points of reflections</h3>
<ul> 	<li>SMEs are at the heart of the European economy, representing 99% of all businesses in the EU[ii].</li> 	<li>With the European Commission’s Clean energy “Winter” Package proposal for a 30% energy efficiency target and climate goals, energy audits targeting SMEs could unlock incredible potential for energy savings in Europe. Unfortunately, the Article on energy audits was not opened and is not going to be revised.</li> 	<li>The Italian model as discussed above could be the ground for replication in other Member States.</li> 	<li>The implementation of the measures derived from the energy audit could be made mandatory for large enterprises (i.e. based on priority, cost-efficiency, etc.).</li> </ul>

<p>""<strong>Important changes in the provision and consumption of electricity services</strong>&nbsp;are now underway, driven to a significant degree by a confluence of factors affecting the distribution side of power systems. A variety of emerging distributed technologies — including&nbsp;<strong>flexible demand, distributed generation, energy storage, and advanced power electronics and control devices</strong>&nbsp;— are creating new options for the provision and consumption of electricity services.

<p>Or in more catchy words - the <strong>game changers in the energy system</strong>.</p>
<p>WEF and McKinsey do see the ""global energy ecosystem in the midst of a transformation at a scale and pace perhaps unseen in a century, buffeted by discontinuities in every direction."" To identify and assess the implicatons of potential game changers, they followed a guiding framework looking at <strong>deep global trends </strong>to identify <strong>potential game changers</strong> and to assess their <strong>potential impact</strong> on business, governments and societies, see Figure 1 below.</p>

<p>You might not be surprised of the outcome in regards to the game changers. WEF and McKinsey identified three:</p>

<ol> 	<li><strong>Advanced energy acceleration</strong></li> 	<li><strong>Mobility revolution</strong></li> 	<li><strong>Energy system fragmentation</strong></li> </ol>
<p>The most relevant part of the whitepaper comes likely at the end - the resulting questions for business, governments and households!</p>
<p>If you think of <strong>the old days</strong> in energy business where the business environment was stable and decisions were done with a <strong>planning horizon of 30-50 years</strong> - you probably get a feeling of the change in front of us. And the enormeous cultural change it requires in the old industries to catch up with this totally new environment. Just think of the following - what is the value of an experience gained in a totally different (old) world?</p>
<p>As always, with the future being uncertain, it is most important to ask the right questions. And this is recognised in the paper. Obviously on a starting point level, but well reflecting on the challenges ahead.</p>
<p>As an example, here are a few questions from the whitepaper for business.</p>
<h3>Questions for incumbent businesses</h3>
<ul> 	<li>Where will certain industries begin to collide and converge with others in the energy system?</li> 	<li>How do businesses build real optionality into their strategies to navigate a highly uncertain future?</li> 	<li>How do businesses harness core competencies to pivot into new or changing sectors?</li> 	<li>How radically do businesses need to reorganize or revamp their organizational capabilities?</li> 	<li>How can businesses use M&amp;A or R&amp;D dollars to gain a foothold in new, unfamiliar, but potentiallybreakthrough sectors?</li> </ul>
<h3>Questions for new entrants</h3>
<ul> 	<li>How do new entrants tap into new sources of capital to ensure their businesses reach “escape velocity”?</li> 	<li>How do new entrants find a competitive foothold in an increasingly integrated system?</li> 	<li>How do new entrants achieve “localization at scale”?</li> </ul>

1070,"Compressed Air: Energy efficiency at the top of the ComVac agenda (HM17)",NULL,NULL,"<p>The latest edition of ComVac will soon be staged: from 24 to 28 April 2017 in Hannover, Germany, under the umbrella of HANNOVER MESSE. All up, some 260 exhibitors will be there in halls 26 and 27 to shocase the current state of the art in <strong>industrial compressed-air and vacuum-air technology</strong>. As well as the perennially important theme of <strong>energy efficiency</strong>, the displays will have a strong focus on <strong>contracting, Industry 4.0 and predictive maintenance</strong>.</p>
<p>""ComVac profiles all areas of the compressed-air and vacuum-air technology industry. This gives our visitors a comprehensive overview of the technology landscape and positions the industry as a key enabler,"" explained Wedell-Castellano, Global Director ComVac, HANNOVER MESSE. ""Moreover, from an exhibitor standpoint, ComVac offers valuable synergies with the other shows at HANNOVER MESSE. That is because the industrial companies who exhibit at those shows are very often also potential buyers of compressed-air and vacuum-air solutions. This synergy benefit is particularly strong with the Energy and MDA (Motion, Drive &amp; Automation) shows, but it also applies to all the other shows at HANNOVER MESSE.""</p>
<p>This year’s ComVac will feature an extensive array of new products and solutions. The following is a selection of highlights.</p>
<p><strong>Atlas Copco Airpower n.v.</strong> (Hall 26, Stand B32) will be showcasing its GA 90+-160+/GA 110-160 VSD series of oil-injected rotary screw compressors. The series’ integrated variable speed drive (VSD) technology and energy recovery systems yield significant energy savings and reductions in operating costs. They also feature latest-generation oil-injected rotary screw elements for longer service life and trouble-free operation. What’s more, the ES central controller links all compressors and dryers and lowers the overall pressure band to achieve further energy savings.</p>
<p>Water condensation is the enemy of industrial compressed-air systems, so it is vital to have effective drying technologies to eliminate water vapor. <strong>BASF SE</strong> (Hall 26, Stand E04) has such a technology – adsorption drying – which it will be unveiling at ComVac. As used in compressed-air systems, adsorption is where molecules of water (the adsorbate) accumulate on the surface of a solid adsorbent medium. Unlike absorption (where the water permeates into a medium like a sponge), the water is ""trapped"" on the surface of the medium, leaving the air dry.</p>
<p>The DRYPOINT® RA series of refrigeration dryers by <strong>BEKO Technologies GmbH</strong> (Hall 26, Stand C31) automatically adjust their output in accordance withcompressed-air withdrawal (demand), thereby reducing partial-load operating costs by up to 70% compared with conventional refrigeration dryers. The technology has applications wherever compressed-air systems and products require reliable protection from condensates and contamination. Drying is achieved by cooling the air, resulting in condensation which is then discharged with no loss of compressed air. The air is then reheated, reducing the relative humidity of the dried air to below 30 percent. The amount of energy used in this process varies according to the required drying performance, thereby further lowering energy costs and protecting the environment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at Stand B56 in Hall 26, <strong>BOGE KOMPRESSOREN Otto Boge GmbH &amp; Co. KG</strong> will be presenting a prototype of its S-4 Optimus rotary screw compressor. The purpose of the S-4 Optimus project is to demonstrate what a quiet, efficient and smart future might look like. When ready, the new series will be even more reliable, intelligent and energy efficient than other commercially available systems. BOGE KOMPRESSOREN will also be presenting an array of standalone devices and components, as well as intelligent machine and central control systems and remote monitoring solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Bosch KWK Systeme GmbH</strong> (Hall 27, Stand E17) is new to ComVac. It will be using the show to present its compressed-air-and-heat system – a variant of combined heat and power (CHP) technology that involves compressed air instead of power. With this system, a gas motor drives an oil-injected screw compressor. Most of the heat in the compressor oil, engine cooling water and exhaust gas is captured by heat exchangers and transferred to the compressed-air heating circuit. This increases overall plant efficiency, cuts energy costs, reduces CO2 emissions and provides certainty in the face of increasingly stringent efficiency and emission regulations.</p>
<p><strong>BRIGE GmbH</strong> will also be at ComVac. The startup will be showcasing its wet cleaning system for overhead conveyor chains. The system is an in-line solution that cleans and dries the chain as it moves through its normal cycle – no conveyor shut-downs required. The dryer uses regenerative blower technology, which reduces energy costs by up to 90% compared with the use of compressed air during the conveyor chain drying process. The system also prevents contamination rejects, minimizes the risk of chain ripping and prolongs the overall chain service life. The cleaning system is suitable for both stationary and mobile applications.</p>
<p><strong>Gardner Denver Deutschland GmbH</strong> (Hall 26, Stand B60) will be using ComVac to present its CompAir Quantima series of oil-free centrifugal air compressors. The CompAir Quantima series avoids oil contamination and offers outstanding energy efficiency, reliability and low environmental impact. And with noise levels of just 69 dB(A), it is also very quiet. What’s more, it has a physical footprint around 25 percent smaller than comparable compressors on the market.</p>
<p>In today’s factories, system reliability is everything, which is why <strong>Ingersoll-Rand International Ltd.</strong> (Hall 26, Stand C12) recently introduced its next-generation R-Series of rotary screw compressors. The airend comprises precision-engineered rotating, intermeshing helical rotors that deliver optimal reliability. The R-Series also offers overall energy efficiency improvements of up to 13 percent compared with legacy products.</p>
<p><strong>Kaeser Kompressoren SE</strong> (Hall 27, Stand E18) will be showcasing its range of rotary screw compressors. All such units in the 30 kW+ range are now equipped with Super Premium Efficiency IE4 motors. Kaeser has also further optimized the airend to increase specific power by up to 12 percent. The company hasachieved yet another milestone with its frequency controlled ASD compressor series, which now have synchronous reluctance motors installed as standard. These offer significantly reduced rotor power losses in the all-important partial-load range compared with asynchronous motors.</p>

<p>The shape of our energy future will reveal itself in the exhibits of the over <strong>1,200 companies</strong> taking part in the&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.hannovermesse.de/en/exhibition/trade-fair-line-up/energy/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Energy</a>&nbsp;show at this year's HANNOVER MESSE. On a combined display area of around 43,000 square meters (462,850 sq. ft), these companies will showcase a diverse array of smart solutions for tomorrow’s integrated energy system. The exhibits will cover the full range of energy topics, from</p>
<ul> 	<li><strong>decentralized supply, </strong></li> 	<li><strong>wind generation, </strong></li> 	<li><strong>integration, </strong></li> 	<li><strong>energy storage, </strong></li> 	<li><strong>energy efficiency and </strong></li> 	<li><strong>electric mobility, right through to </strong></li> 	<li><strong>smart grids.</strong></li> </ul>
<p>The Energy show will be supported by a series of technical forums in halls 12, 13 and 27. ""The forums will have 'integrated energy' as their umbrella theme and feature lively expert discussion of all the key issues that are critical to the future of our energy system,"" says Benjamin Low, Deutsche Messe's Global Director in charge of the Energy show at HANNOVER MESSE.</p>
<p>The Integrated <strong>Energy Plaza</strong> will once again be the beating heart of this year’s Energy show. It will feature its own forum program, company exhibits and interactive displays.</p>
<p>Key themes in 2017 will be the</p>

<ul> 	<li><strong>digitalization of the energy transition, </strong></li> 	<li><strong>virtual power plants,</strong></li> 	<li><strong>energy system integration</strong> and</li> 	<li>innovative <strong>energy storage solutions</strong>.</li> </ul>
<p>The Plaza's lineup of exhibits include a display of the current <strong>Kopernikus energy transition projects</strong> of the <em>German Federal Ministry of Education and Research</em> as well as an update on the latest projects run under the ""Shop Window for Intelligent Energy – <strong>Digital Agenda for the Energy Transition"" (SINTEG) development program</strong> of the <em>German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy</em>. The Plaza's forum program will be organized by the German Energy Agency (dena) in partnership with a number of German industry associations, including the bdew, BEE, bne, GTAI, VDE, VDMA, VKU and ZVEI.</p>
<p>""Achieving a future-proof energy system is about much more than just digitalizing all the individual components. What is called for is a concerted, integrated energy transition – a highly coordinated effort involving all the key players and technologies, across all the relevant sectors. The companies and organizations at the Integrated Energy Plaza will demonstrate how this can be done in practice. ""We will present the initial results of our pilot study into a framework for an integrated energy transition that ensures the commercial viability of the process going forward,"" explains dena CEO Andreas Kuhlmann.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Veit Hagenmeyer from the Institute of Applied Computer Science at the <strong>Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)</strong>, ""the transition from a centralized to a more decentralized energy system will be the key challenge on the way to achieving a reliable, affordable and clean energy supply."" He considers tapping into renewables the equivalent of ""an energy harvesting operation over a huge geographic area"". His organization, the KIT, is committed to meeting the R&amp;D challenges posed by the energy transition, and Dr. Hagenmeyer has a clear <strong>vision of the what tomorrow’s energy system must be capable of</strong>: ""It’s critical that any excess energy from renewable sources be retained through energy storage, including in other energy carriers, or rendered usable through smart demand-side management and grid management."" The conversion of surplus wind or solar energy into other energy carriers will be a crucial element of any future energy system. This can be done in a number of ways, for instance, by large-scale electrolysis plants that produce hydrogen, or by a variety of power-to-liquid or power-to-chemicals systems.</p>
<p>Another of the Integrated Energy Plaza’s participants, the leading energy and telecom cable manufacturer <strong>Prysmian Group</strong>, will focus on <strong>high-performance smart girds as the backbone of tomorrow’s energy system</strong>. ""The secure and reliable in-feed and transmission of renewable energy is one of the big remaining challenges. We are working hard to develop products for every part of the energy system that will help ensure the successful transition from today’s centralized to tomorrow’s distributed generation systems. HVDC transmission is particularly important in this context, because its represents a more environmentally friendly alternative for efficiently transporting large electricity volumes over vast distances,"" explained Hans Koch, Chief Commercial Officer of Prysmian Group Germany. ""Medium and low-voltage cables for electric distribution to consumers as well as cables connecting on- and offshore wind parks to the grid are just as critical, of course.""</p>
<p><strong>But the energy transition will not just require physical integration. It will also rely on the sharing of information. </strong></p>
<p>""What’s needed is a mindset that puts integration and systems at the top of the agenda,"" stresses Low. ""Which is why the Energy show is specifically designed to bring together the different players in the energy sector and to foster constructive dialogue about smart solutions that will stand the test of time.""</p>
<p><strong>At the heart of all this will be digitalization</strong>.</p>
<p>Alf Henryk Wulf, <strong>GE Power</strong> AG’s Executive Board Chairman: ""All the energy sector players are looking to secure their competitive edge by using digital technologies to connect their assets and perform data analysis. That’s why we designed our own Predix operating system: to enable companies to harness the power of the industrial internet and drive the digital transformation of our industry. A year on from its release, Predix already has a user base of over 23,000 developers worldwide. The digitalization of the energy sector will enable all the various energy system assets – from various forms of electric power generation, to transmission and storage, right through to consumption – to operate reliably and efficiently.""</p>

1072,"Energy efficiency in the spotlight at HM17",NULL,NULL,"<h3>More growth for less energy consumption?</h3>
<p>Energy efficiency can make it happen. This year, the Energy show at HANNOVER MESSE will again feature a large number of companies demonstrating precisely this point.</p>
<p>One of these companies is <strong>Glen Dimplex Deutschland GmbH</strong>. The German subsidiary of the international Glen Dimplex Group supplies heating and cooling systems ranging from domestic heat pumps to industrial installations. Director Marketing Communications Sigmund Perner outlines the company's perspective on energy efficiency: ""As an industry, we need to do more to <strong>integrate the use of heating and cooling.</strong> At the moment, these systems tend to be separate. But by integrating them using intelligent temperature management systems, we can achieve major cost savings for industrial users."" Perner also notes that much remains to be done over the next few years to ensure compliance with the upcoming ban on environmentally harmful refrigerants.</p>
<p>Not that heating and cooling are the only areas that offer efficiency gains. In fact, there is <strong>room for improvement in almost all other areas of production</strong>. Admittedly, realizing those gains is sometimes difficult because the current relatively low oil prices are a barrier to securing large-scale investment in energy-saving technology. However <strong>part of the problem is awareness</strong>, or rather, lack of it. Which is why, in Germany, companies from a wide range of backgrounds have banded together to form <strong>""Energieeffizienz 360"" - an initiative aimed at raising awareness of energy issues in industrial circles</strong>. The initiative comprises <strong>Glen Dimplex Deutschland GmbH, Kaeser Kompressoren SE (compressed-air systems), Neuenhauser (LED technology, lighting) and Gildemeister (energy-efficiency consulting)</strong>. One part of the initiative's brief is to highlight the enormously broad scope for efficiency-enhancing technical optimization in industrial contexts. The other is to raise awareness of the fact that individual parts of the energy paradigm can be integrated using the latest advances in digitalization, thereby making them more efficient both to operate and to control.</p>
<p>Achieving this integration requires well-designed data-driven energy management systems. The success of such systems hinges on capturing, visualizing and analyzing energy data with reference to the underlying production data. ""It's about tracking how much energy is used, where it is used and when,"" explains Karsten Reese, General Manager of <strong>IngSoft GmbH</strong>, a company that will be exhibiting at the Digital Energy display in Hall 12 at the Energy show. IngSoft GmbH develops software for integrated energy management. ""The product innovation that we will be presenting relates to a software solution that uses automated algorithms to detect patterns from among thousands of energy load profiles,"" explains Reese, who welcomes the growing interest in energy transparency among industrial firms.</p>
<p>Of course, transparency requires good data, and for that you need accurate, smart measurement technology of the kind that <strong>Janitza electronics GmbH</strong> will be presenting at the Energy show. The core functions of Janitza's measurement technology include voltage quality determination, differential current measurement and residual current detection. These themes of integration, measurement and energy efficiency will doubtless also be among the topics that trade visitors and experts will be discussing in depth in the forums and at the exhibitor stands at this year's Energy show. In all of these discussions, the focus will be on energy management solutions that help reduce plant operating costs and boost competitiveness.</p>
<p>Providers of the technologies that drive energy efficiency are experiencing growing demand from the manufacturing industry. This is undoubtedly due in part to the recent introduction of mandatory energy auditing in some countries, including Germany, pursuant to EU law.But it is also being driven by the wave of digitalization that is sweeping practically all manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>But whatever its form and motivation, every energy-efficiency project must make sound business sense in today's competitive market. ""Energy efficiency should not be an end in itself. <strong>Improving energy efficiency across the entire production and supply chain will only work if the individual users, owners and investors in the chain perceive it as offering them concrete benefits</strong>,"" says Stefan Kapferer, Chairman of the Executive Board of the German Energy and Water Industry Federation (BDEW). ""A heavy-handed approach to energy-efficiency regulation could potentially stifle growth in the European economy. It could also lead to increased compliance bureaucracy and be very costly to administer. And that would erode public acceptance of energy efficiency programs,"" Kapferer warns. As alternatives to regulation, he cites various great advances over the past 25 years which, he says, were achieved without major legislative intervention: ""Between 1991 and 2015, Germany's energy productivity - the ratio of economic output to energy consumption - improved by just on 50 percent.""</p>

<p>Juergen is happy to meet you at your booth at HM.</p>

<h3>Meet the Twitter stars</h3>

<p>And we are pleased to welcome you on <strong>Wednesday, the 26th at 15:00 at EEIP partner company Wattline</strong> for a ""meet &amp; greet"" of the EEIP Twitter stars. Just drop by at <strong>hall 27, booth N30 in the Energy Efficiency Center</strong> and meet other front runners of industrial energy efficiency.</p>
<p>We</p>
<p>love talking about how EEIP is leading changes with bridging social</p>
<p>media and industry and energy sectors, how we are enabling SMEs to reach</p>
<p>new customers and what is coming next in social media marketing for</p>
<p>energy efficiency. And we love to hear about your experiences!</p>



<h3>We live in truly exciting times.</h3>
<p>Not only that Internet of Things and Industries 4.0 interconnects manufacturing processes and services, but it unlock information barriers that are the biggest challenge for energy efficiency industries.</p>
<p>When in 2011, on the behalf of&nbsp;EEIP&nbsp;(Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes), I attended Hannover Messe for the first time, marketing and engagement on social media was nowhere to be seen (and not only because of the hugely expensive wi-fi on the show). EEIP just started and within 6 moths we were already global leaders in energy efficiency on Twitter. Our audiences were interested and hungry on what is happening in industrial energy efficiency, and we delivered and still do today case studies, best practices, etc.</p>
<p>Today the social media at Hannover Messe is business reality, and EEIP are still the top influencer in our sector. Traffic/use of Twitter has increased significantly in the period of 2012 (when conversations were first referenced, #HM12) to 2014, (more than doubled every year), still the numbers only exploded in the last two years.</p>
<p>So, what is the potential of Twitter for industrial and energy sectors. When we set up EEIP as a not-for-profit industrial energy efficiency network in 2011 we projected the growth of the industrial energy efficiency social media audience to be just above 40,000. Today our niche professional network is over 130,000 strong, and continues to grow by hundred each day.</p>
<p>For years we have been recording out network activities with companies starting to do actual business on Twitter. Now this is no longer anecdotal, we see Twitter conversations leading to sales of industrial equipment, investment in projects or promoting innovative energy efficiency solutions. Twitter is now an effective business tool.</p>

1077,"Can data analytics replace people in energy efficiency?",NULL,NULL,"<p><em>from Steve Baab, DNV GL</em></p>
<h2>Can data analytics replace people in energy efficiency?</h2>
<p><strong>Big data and analytics</strong> have been buzzwords for quite some time now.&nbsp; Within the utility space, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) has opened up new opportunities to collect and use energy usage data.&nbsp; In the past, most utilities only collected usage information based on the type of meter and the reading schedule.&nbsp; Different meter types collected different amounts of information.&nbsp; Larger customers would have energy usage (kWh) and demand (kW) in various intervals (monthly, hourly, every 30 min…).&nbsp; For all customers, the reading schedule was usually monthly and was performed manually by a meter reader. With AMI systems there is an opportunity to collect data without sending someone out into the field, and to collect the data whenever a utility wants it, rather than on a prescribed schedule.&nbsp; Utilities implementing AMI systems usually install three major components: the meters, the network to communicate with the meters, and the meter data information system.&nbsp; For a utility to decide to install an AMI system, the benefits (labor savings, operational efficiencies, customer satisfaction) need to justify the costs.</p>
<p>One of the largest <strong>benefits of installing AMI networks on the utility side are labor savings</strong>. Utility meter reader jobs are perhaps the most significantly impacted with an AMI network, but there are other areas of labor savings.&nbsp; The ability to pinpoint outages, reduce bill estimation work, and remotely disconnect service are also areas where an AMI network can reduce labor costs.&nbsp; For customer satisfaction, having interval data available allows a utility to offer its customers more flexible billing options and enhanced information on consumption.</p>
<p>But what about putting the interval usage data to work for energy efficiency?&nbsp; <strong>Can the increased granularity of usage data save labor within efficiency programs?</strong>&nbsp; There’s a decent amount of information housed within all that data.&nbsp; When interval data is combined with external data such as building type, size, and age, an analyst or maybe even simple computer algorithms could provide savings recommendations. This could potentially save labor by not having to visit customers to find savings through an audit or assessment.</p>
<p>Although analytics is extremely helpful in identifying for potential customers where there may be energy efficiency opportunities, <strong>I don’t think it will ever evolve to the point where it will replace people (or at least within the next 10-20 years).</strong>&nbsp; Here’s why:</p>
<h3>Existing load information can’t determine exactly what’s creating the load pattern.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>DNV GL and others are getting good at identifying load shape patterns using advanced data. Detailed load shapes support impact evaluations, potential studies, and informs efficiency and demand response programs.&nbsp; However, on a customer by customer basis, analytics can only provide directional vs. actionable information.&nbsp; Analytics can only point you in the right direction, but you’ll have no way of knowing for sure without a visual confirmation.</p>
<h3>Inability to determine the exact type of equipment generating the loads.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Software and analytics are getting very sophisticated at identifying load patterns, but there is still uncertainty in customer behavior and equipment that creates the load pattern.&nbsp; An inefficient cooling system or an occupant’s preference to have their building two degrees cooler than everyone else can create similar load patterns. (Also poor insulation, high internal loads, or anything else driving abnormal cooling loads.)&nbsp; Analytics can provide good directional indicators based on interval meter data, but only a person knowledgeable in energy efficiency and the site’s equipment can provide tangible recommendations to reduce energy use.</p>
<h3><strong>Human interaction drives interest in energy efficiency</strong></h3>
<p>Reports, emails, text messages, or web portals can all help drive some interest and awareness, but nothing triggers a call to action like a real person.&nbsp; For the same reason sales jobs are not going away anytime soon, the role of energy efficiency experts who perform audits and/or assessments will also not go away in the near term.&nbsp; During an energy assessment, the customer and the energy efficiency expert will get a chance to interact.&nbsp; The energy efficiency expert will learn about the customer, the customer will learn about energy efficiency, and&nbsp;<strong>together</strong>&nbsp;they will establish mutual&nbsp;<strong>trust</strong>&nbsp;and then develop the best course of action to save energy.</p>
<p><strong>In summary</strong>, analytics may be able to uncover some of the technical potential of energy efficiency and guide staff on which customers to visit, but it will never be able to gauge the interest and motivation of customers that have the choice to spend time and money on energy efficiency (or not). Getting people to become more energy efficient requires a conversation with the people who are using energy.&nbsp; There is a big difference between buildings that have the technical potential to save energy and customers that have the interest and act upon recommendations.&nbsp; In my experience, face to face conversations work much better than computer algorithms.</p>

1078,"Compressed air - Hannover Messe 2017 follow up",NULL,NULL,"<h2>Compressed-Air-and-Heat-System</h2>
<p>As a partner of leading global industry fair Hannover Messe, we are always spending a few days at the fair to ""scout"" some relevant technology and service solutions. This year we will showcase findings from compressed air over vacuum pump systems to smart IT or IoT solutions.</p>
<p>Let´s start with ""Compressed Air"". Or even more precise with a <strong>CAHS</strong> which stands for ""<strong>compressed air and heat system</strong>"".</p>
<p>Almost every company depends on the generation of compressed air as it is the 2nd most important industrial energy source besides electricity. Advantages are rather obvious: fast reaction times, constant performance and a high level of occupational safety, especially for potentially explosive environments.</p>
<p>Looking on the cost side, one exhibitor mentioned that <strong>for compressed air systems, 50% of LCC (life Cycle Costs) are energy costs</strong>. Well, it seems fairly reasonable to look for solutions to get energy costs down.</p>
<h3>A solution</h3>

<p>When compressing air, 100% of the mechanical energy is converted into thermal energy. According to company altAIRnative, <strong>CAHS, a system which produces compressed air as a by-product of the heat generation</strong>, can reach (theoretically) 100% effectiveness.</p>
<p><em>Here the related energy flow diagram</em></p>

<p>This solution is not only meaningful for many industrial processes across many sectors (see overview below : share of heat demand by temperature), but it also benefits from the price differnece between electricity and gas as the latter is used for the ""by-production"" of compressed air. In other words short pay-back periods.</p>

In 120 pages, the report takes you on a journey to 10 cost-effective technical solutions that each can reduce European greenhouse gas emissions by several hundred million tons per year.</p>
<h4>Ecosystem that connects technologies, policies, and markets</h4>
<p>The goal of our DecarbEurope initiative is to engage decision-makers in policy and industry by showing cost-effective technical solutions that each reduce European greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by several hundred million tons per year. The campaign is an initiative of the European Copper Institute, in a partnership with 9 organizations and 2 media partners.</p>
<p>According to Bernard Respaut, Chief Executive of European Copper Institute, this campaign is a clear wake-up call for action: “The European Union’s leadership on climate change relies on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy-intensive sectors, and equally all the way down their respective value chains. To reach reductions that will keep us well below 2 degrees Celsius as stipulated at the CoP21 in Paris 2015, we need structured support for the full decarbonisation of technologies to foster economic growth and to consolidate EU leadership on addressing climate change globally. This unique campaign provides a cross-sector roadmap that is not limited to a single technology.”</p>
<h4>At the forefront of the Clean Energy transition</h4>
<p>Each solution promoted by DecarbEurope is technology-based, cost-effective, market-mature, scalable and provides concrete solutions for a smart and user-centric energy system with ambitious targets. DecarbEurope wants to encourage policy and market instruments to remove barriers that are currently hindering those solutions from full-scale activation. And that message has not passed unnoticed, witness the foreword by Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete: “To create growth and jobs, the EU industry must be at the forefront of the clean energy transition. Accordingly, the Commission welcomes industry-led initiatives that might strengthen industrial links in the overall value chain and integrate non-economic actors such as social partners and consumer organisations. Initiatives like DecarbEurope can help to promote the EU global leadership in clean energy and low-carbon technological solutions.”</p>
<h4>DecarbEurope 2017 Report: engaging with technology</h4>
<p>The report is an answer to a growing need to make technology clearly intelligible to decision makers. For each technology, a revealing infographic introduces the reader to its features and benefits. The vast economic and environmental potential - and how to unlock it - becomes immediately clear with the 10 remarkable facts and 5 concrete policy recommendations. To dispel any remaining doubts, the report also presents 30 convincing case studies from all over Europe and 10 interviews with industry leaders who share their future outlook with the reader. A first 2,500 copies of the 120-page report will be distributed on several occasions, such as during during the European Sustainable Energy Week 2017 in June.</p>

1080,"The G20 Energy Efficiency Forum and the Energy Efficiency Investment Toolkit",NULL,NULL,"<p>On 2nd&nbsp;May I was fortunate enough to present at the G20 Energy Efficiency Forum and take part in a panel discussion.&nbsp; The G20 energy efficiency work has not got much attention but there are some good things happening and at the event the group, with 15 participating countries chaired by France and Mexico, launched its <strong>G20 Energy Efficiency Toolkit</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The toolkit offers a perspective on scaling up energy efficiency investments by defining and separating</p>
<ul> 	<li><strong>“core” EE investments</strong> – those stand-alone projects where energy savings are the main driver and</li> 	<li><strong>“integral” investments</strong> where overall asset performance is the lead driver but energy efficiency is delivered as one of multiple benefits over and above the main driver.&nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p>The global investment in energy efficiency has been identified by the IEA as $221bn with the US, EU and China representing 70% of the total.&nbsp; Within the EU 80% of the total investments were in buildings, with over 90% in Germany, UK and France.&nbsp; The toolkit reports that the largest “core” energy efficiency investment is in the market for Energy Performance Contracts which totalled $24 billion.&nbsp; I assume this means third party investment as internal balance sheet financed projects are surely much higher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>G20 EE Toolkit offers advice to different groups</strong> including policy makers, private sector banks, institutional investors and the insurance sector.&nbsp; It also gives case studies from various countries including Mexico, France, China, Australia and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are parallels with my energy productivity work for KAPSARC.&nbsp; In that I distinguished between “energy efficiency” investments and “normal investments”, a definition which parallels the G20’s “core” and “integral”.&nbsp; Energy efficiency investments are those where the main purpose is energy saving.&nbsp; This includes much of what we usually think of as energy efficiency, retrofitting buildings or production lines for example.&nbsp; While these are important at any one time hundreds of investment decisions are being taken on all kinds of infrastructure that will affect our energy consumption and emissions for the next twenty to fifty years or even beyond.&nbsp; Most of these are not “energy efficiency investments” but “normal” investments where the main purpose is not energy efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pure energy efficiency investments can be ramped up by specialised funds or facilities and public-private partnerships with public finance providing development capital and guarantees. Any programme needs to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li>Provide finance</li> 	<li>Build pipelines of projects</li> 	<li>Build capacity in end-users, energy efficiency industry and finance industry</li> 	<li>Standardize development process, documentation, contracts and measurement&nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p>Encouraging the growth of the ESCO-EPC market also helps drive pure energy efficiency investments.&nbsp; This can be done through models like ESCO-EPC facilitation (e.g. Berlin, RE:FIT) and Super-ESCOs (e.g. Etihad).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also important to <strong>build market infrastructure through</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li>Standardization of process (e.g. Investor Confidence Project)</li> 	<li>Standardization of contracts (e.g. standard EPCs)</li> 	<li>Standardization of Measurement &amp; Verification</li> 	<li>Build evidence bases of project performance</li> 	<li>Build capacity within financial sector.&nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p>It is also important to continue to build demand through strong Minimum Energy Performance Standards and building capacity in energy management through standards e.g. ISO 50001&nbsp;</p>
<p>As well as ramping up pure energy efficiency or core investments we need to ensure the efficiency opportunities presented by normal investments are not being missed.&nbsp; Even if you design a building to code and that makes it low energy compared to existing buildings it is not really doing anything to improve the situation – I would not count it as an energy efficiency investment. It is a normal investment and a missed opportunity to include cost-effective energy efficiency measures.&nbsp; Every day, in design and investment decisions around the world, the economic potential to improve energy efficiency beyond business as usual is being missed.&nbsp; We need to change that through better regulation, capacity building amongst investors, specifiers and designers and implementing better design processes such as integrated design.&nbsp; Banks and investors can help this process by building in checks and questions during their investment decision making.&nbsp; These processes should force borrowers to review their specifications and designs.&nbsp; EBRD has been doing this for a long time.&nbsp; By doing this the banks can reduce customer risks by reducing their energy bills and increase the deployment of capital into cost-effective opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To scale up energy efficiency we need to take actions to increase the rate energy efficiency investments, and actions to increase the uptake of cost-effective efficiency opportunities within normal investments.</p>

1081,"Introduction: Electro-heat technologies",NULL,NULL,"<p>Electromagnetic processing technologies use wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum that correspond to microwave, radio waves, infrared, and ultra violet to heat materials. Direct heating methods generate heat within a work piece, by either passing an electrical current through the material, or inducing an electrical current (eddy current) into the material. These technologies offer significant benefits compared to the fossil fuel alternatives and contribute to decarbonization by not producing on-site emissions. Depending on the way electricity is generated, these technologies will lead to an improvement in overall air quality. Other common advantages of electro-heat technologies, apart from the lower environmental impact, are:</p>
<ul> 	<li>A lower investment cost</li> 	<li>A compact installation relative to the production capacity</li> 	<li>No fuel transport and storage is required</li> </ul>
<p>The inherent power of most electro-heat technologies lies in the fact that they generate heat within the target material, leading to advantages in terms of process control and end-use energy efficiency. Typically, a factor two improvement in end-use efficiency can be observed, depending on the process. This means that electromagnetic processing can potentially halve the final energy demand for EU process heat which is 20% of final energy demand in the EU.</p>

1082,"Cleantech startups: German utilities bridging the valley of death?",NULL,NULL,"<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>4 reasons why Cleantech startups failed in the past</strong></h2>
<p>Starting a new company in the energy sector, especially in the clean tech branch, is risky and every so often not successful. Still, in the period from 2006-2008 clean tech was one of the hot topics for venture capital funds.</p>
<blockquote><p>John Doerr, a partner at the prominent Silicon Valley VC firm Kleiner Perkins, announced in a 2007 TED talk that, “Green technologies—going green—is bigger than the internet. It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Basically, this enthusiasm about clean tech was driven by high oil prices, which were anticipated to rise further and far beyond 100$/barrel. Today, we know that these expectations were not met.</p>
<p>Cleantech startups weren’t able to meet the high expectations either. At the MIT&nbsp;<a href=""https://energy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MITEI-WP-2016-06.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Gaddy et al (2016)</a>&nbsp;compared the data from clean tech with two other technology sectors:&nbsp;Software and Medical. From this data we can learn that cleantech startups performed very poorly compared to startups in the other sectors (even though the two sectors had a comparable environment for startups).</p>
<p><img alt=""Figure 1: Risk and reward for cleantech investors compared to software and medical technologies (source: Gaddy et al.

<p>Figure 1:&nbsp;Risk and reward for cleantech investors compared to software and medical technologies (source:&nbsp;<a href=""https://energy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MITEI-WP-2016-06.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Gaddy et al. (2016)</a>)</p>
<p>Figure 1 illustrates the relatively high failure rate of clean tech startups as well as the resulting low Internal Rate of Return (IRR). In 2010, Google acquired Nest, which is the only reason why the IRR in 2010 for cleantech is above -25%.</p>
<p>Now, what are the reasons why clean tech startups struggle so much?</p>
<p>Gaddy et al (2016) identify four reasons that help us to understand why cleantech startups perform so badly compared to software and medical startups.</p>
<ol> 	<li>Cleantech Development needs time (normally longer than the 3-5 years which are expected by venture capital funds)</li> 	<li>Cleantech is expensive to scale as you need large factories even before your product is finalized</li> 	<li>Cleantech focuses on commodity markets with high competition and low margins, which reduces the ability to invest in Research &amp;Development</li> 	<li>Cleantech lags incumbent companies that are willing to take the risk and acquire startups</li> </ol>
<p>The first two reasons can explain why clean tech underperforms compared to software startups and why most startups outside the clean tech sector are focusing on digital products or services. But high investment costs for R&amp;D and production are required for the medical sector as well. Here, clean tech loses the comparison because of the last reason mentioned above. While companies in the medical sector have always been willing to invest in startups to bridge the gap between venture capital and mass market, energy utilities were not. Cleantech startups therefore entered the&nbsp;<em>valley of death&nbsp;between prototyping and mass markets. But this is changing.</em></p>

<p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Till 2015, German utilities were quite reluctant to invest in RES and in companies whose business case was solely focuses on these technologies. This was mainly due to the fact that an investment in RES would have resulted in the cannibalism of the conventional power generation businesses.&nbsp;In this&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://b-e-r.user.jacobs-university.de/bewp/bewp23.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window""><strong>paper</strong></a>&nbsp;we discuss how the utilities in Germany were challenged by RES and how they tried to adapt to this situation starting in 2015. In a nutshell, the analysis in this paper comes down to this: RES in Germany reduces the average price (-50% between 2008 and 2014) for electricity generation sold via the spot market, which reduces the revenue for conventional power plants. Since 2010, these price reductions reached a level where it becomes difficult for conventional power plants to operate at least on a cost-covering basis. Therefore, an investment by a utility into RES or RES-related businesses would result in a further reduction of revenue from the conventional business, which is why we talk about cannibalism in this context.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></p>
<p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>In consequence, uutilities therefore focused on their conventional business and hesitated to invest in RES-related businesses. Starting in 2015, the two largest utilities in Germany changed their strategy. E.on as well as RWE split their companies into two independent branches: One company focusing on the conventional generation business (uniper in the case of E.on and RWE) and one company for RES, retail and network operation (E.on and innogy in the case of RWE). With these splits, the cannibalism problem became obsolete: innogy and E.on now don’t have any conventional power plants in their portfolio giving them the freedom to invest in RES and RES-related businesses.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></p>

<p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>In addition to the change of the organizational structure, both innogy and E.on have applied new innovation processes. While startups and startup-investments did not use to play a huge role in the German utility sector, this has changed to some extent since 2015. Many German utilities have established accelerator programs for energy startups, among them E.on and innogy. While these developments are still in the early beginning, they are one milestone towards a more innovation-oriented energy business.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></p>

We know from the telecommunication sector that a switch from capital-intensive innovation process towards data-driven business models can accelerate the innovation process. Maybe we will see a similar dynamic market development within a digital energy economy as well.

1083,"Young Innovative Companies series: ENOGIA - small scale ORC solutions",NULL,NULL,"<h3>Have you ever heard about ENOGIA?</h3>
<p>We always like to go to Hannover Messe. It is a giant fair but if you give yourself some time to walk around without fixed meeting schedule, each year you can find inspiring developments, new solutions and - small young companies fighting hard to be recognised (think of a 4 sqm booth vs e.g. the 4000? sqm Siemens booth).</p>
<p>One of the companies we found was <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.enogia.com/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>ENOGIA</strong></a>, a small French company that has specialised on ORC for the small scale power and low temperature field (80 degrees+).</p>
<h3>Small scale power and low temperature</h3>
<p>In my discussion with Pierre-Emmanuel Kiehl from ENOGIA, he said that ""ORC technology is pretty old and has been operated for many years by manufacturers on very high power outputs (many MW electrical) and very high temperatures. <strong>The electrical power we can provide (between 5 and 100kW) is a field where the players of the market never entered because of the technological problems it could lead to. We decided to manage this small scale of power and low temperatures (apart from 80°C for the heat source)</strong> to answer particular customer needs who could not find any profitable and reliable solution for their waste heat"".</p>
<h3>Size mattters</h3>
<p>Another benefit he mentioned is related to <strong>size</strong>. According to him, they can provide solutions in far smaller dimensions than usual especially relevant for use in applications with very limited space - an issue many companies are facing.</p>
<p>ENOGIA, founded in 2009 by 4 engineers, has started to market its modules in 2013. Since then they managed to install <strong>40 applications across the globe</strong> in ares such as CSP, biogas units, biomass boilers, geothermal wells and industrial waste heat recovery. In 2010, they have received the French Award ""Young Innovative Company"" from the French Ministry of Research.</p>
<h3>Application example</h3>

<p>We have also asked them to provide us with same kind of technical information for different applications. You can see below an example for an <strong>industrial waste heat recovery solution with 500 kW/th.</strong></p>

1084,"Launch at EUSEW 2017: Investors for energy efficiency in industry, district energy and street lighting",NULL,NULL,"<p>If we are to make headway in achieving our energy efficiency objectives, ensuring financing is essential. While there are some low-cost measures, the bulk of what needs to be done is relatively costly. The <strong>Investor Confidence Project (ICP)</strong> was brought to Europe to develop a system to give confidence to all active stakeholders. <strong>There are still concerns that investing in energy efficiency is risky. ICP is designed to change that</strong>. ICP started with investments in buildings and is now broadening the scope. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Policy target: 30%</h3>
<p>The European Commission’s clean energy package from last November combines both legislative and non-legislative initiatives. Importantly, the package calls for a more ambitious energy savings target for 2030 that has more teeth in it. <strong>Now the Commission is calling for a 30% target, but importantly they want it to be binding.</strong> This is consistent with the EU meeting its obligations under the 2015 global climate agreement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission is also trying to get the market to work more effectively in all sectors. Since the oil crises of the 1970s, there has been regular discussion about market barriers – why the potential for cost-effective energy efficiency improvements are not taking place. Policies that are put in place are now by and large designed to address one or more of those persistent barriers. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes</em> is now a member of a group trying out a new approach to help ensure adequate financing is not only available but that the potential projects actually get implemented. We all know that if a measure (from lighting to pumping systems) is not implemented, there will be no savings, other than some that can happen with normal housekeeping. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>ICP concept</h3>
<p>The concept is relatively simple to understand. A potential project in a factory or a district heating system, for example, is identified. Someone has to do the necessary calculations to determine the viability. Someone has to be identified to install it (often the same organisation). And some organisation needs to fund it. What this project does is standardise the procedures so that all players gain confidence in the system. The factory owner is happy. The developer/auditor/installer is happy. The financial institution is happy. There are protocols in place and third party monitoring to ensure everything is done correctly. The protocols are developed by interested experts and not by commercial interests. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach, first brought out in the United States, was used for buildings, mainly multi-family and commercial buildings.&nbsp; This approach was then brought to Europe for buildings as well. Importantly, the European Commission is funding it. The final stages of the first phase are now being completed. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>ICP for&nbsp;industry, street lighting and district energy</h3>
<p>The Commission is now supporting a further evolution of the concept into industry and infrastructure. The two aspects of infrastructure are district heating and street lighting. This two-year project is just starting.&nbsp; It benefits from lessons learned in the buildings component because much of the methodology is similar. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Industry in Europe can certainly benefit from this. Thirty thousand companies have had mandatory audits undertaken. How many recommended projects do they represent? From anecdotal information, it is understood that few of those recommendations have been financed to date. And it is equally understood that there are good opportunities for the growing field of district energy. With major technological advances, there are also many opportunities for street lighting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This new project, entitled the Investor Confidence Project for&nbsp;industry, street lighting and district energy, will take time to set the right framework for undertaking those recommendations. But, ICP has the opportunity to make a difference and build a good foundation for having all stakeholders gain confidence and actually undertake the actions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This way, industry can set an important example and actually do its share in meeting our 2030 targets and our Paris climate obligations.</p>

1086,"UNIDO: Industrial energy efficiency: Picking the low-hanging fruit",NULL,NULL,"<p>The following article is the keynote article in the Global Sustain Yearbook 2016/17 by <strong>LI Yong, Director General of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). </strong></p>
<p>Li Yong focusses on two aspects:</p>
<ol> 	<li>The benefits of implementing <strong>Energy Management Systems</strong> and - especially - the <strong>non-energy-benefits</strong></li> 	<li>The role of <strong>innovation</strong></li> </ol>
<p>You can find his article below with some areas highlighted and some headings added for easier reading as well as further links incl a link to full Yearbook, ""The Energy [R]Evolution"" e-book, published by Global Sustain.</p>
<h3>The challenge</h3>
<p>Across the globe, industry is a large consumer of energy. Today the industrial sector accounts for almost 40% of the world’s total final energy consumption. And, over the next two decades, industry’s demand for energy is expected to further increase, at a rate of 1.3% annually. Industry is also the single largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accounting for nearly one third of total global emissions.</p>
<p><strong>The good news is that the adoption of energy efficiency measures could reduce industrial energy use by over 25%</strong>. The potential for energy efficiency in the industrial sector is substantial. Not only does industrial energy efficiency reduce overall energy consumption – thereby reducing many countries’ dependence on energy imports – it also encourages development, creates jobs and decreases pollution. Indeed, efforts to improve industrial energy efficiency are critical to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals, especially those related to climate change and sustainable energy.</p>
<p><strong>One of the main barriers</strong> to energy efficiency in the industrial sector is that industrial companies focus on driving production and most are <strong>not aware of the multiple benefits of implementing energy efficiency activities or of the array of available technologies</strong>. But, over the last two decades, Energy Management Systems (EnMS) have emerged as a proven best practice methodology to ensure sustainable energy efficiency and continually improve industrial performance. (An Energy Management System is a series of processes that enables people of varied responsibilities across an organization to use data and information to maintain and improve energy performance, while improving operational efficiencies, decreasing energy intensity, and reducing environmental impacts.)</p>
<h3>The role of EnMS - ISO 50001</h3>
<p>The globally accepted and recognized standard for EnMS is ISO 50001 and its implementation can assist industry in developing strategies and processes to manage energy use, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and improve environmental performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Policies and market mechanisms that encourage the uptake of EnMS within industry can be highly effective for improving efficiency. This is because an <strong>energy management system establishes closer linkages between energy efficiency and core industry values, such as cost reduction, increased productivity, environmental compliance and global competitiveness.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Over the past decade, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) has been supporting enterprises in developing countries and emerging economies with the implementation of EnMS, thereby helping them improve their energy performance, productivity and environmental sustainability. For companies in developing countries that are new to it, energy management can yield energy savings of 5 to 15% in the first one to two years of implementation. [<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.energypages.org/company/CompanyPage/show/yourenergy/"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">for examples in the form of short case studies, check here</a>] EnMS are so effective in achieving significant and sustainable reductions in energy consumption that many governments require large energy end users to implement them. Most countries in Europe have already made energy management central to their energy efficiency programmes.</p>
<p>Governments wanting to create the conditions to facilitate the adoption of energy management and implement ISO 50001 need to put in place policies and mechanisms that promote its uptake. In developing a policy mix that best suits the industrial sector, it is important to analyze the instruments and schemes that are in use across the world and to present relevant considerations to policymakers in developing countries.</p>
<h3>Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS)</h3>
<p>Setting <strong>energy performance standards for industrial equipment</strong> is another area that holds significant potential for energy savings in industry. Many developed countries already have mandatory Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) in place for a range of energy consuming equipment within industry, while many developing countries are also moving towards the introduction of mandatory MEPS for industrial equipment <strong>such as motors and boilers</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Efficient components may bring about gains in the range of two to five per cent, but systems optimization measures can attain average efficiency gains of 20 to 30%</strong> with a payback period of less than two years. Therefore, efforts to address the obstacles for optimizing energy efficiency in the design, operation and maintenance of industrial energy systems will have to be made in order to capture the full economic and environmental potential of energy efficiency.</p>
<h3>Innovation</h3>
<p>Looking ahead to the future of energy efficiency in industry, the other key driver/factor to achieve a transformational change to lower-carbon and higher-productivity development paths is innovation – and by that I mean innovation in technologies, applications, production processes and business models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technology innovation has reached the top of policymakers’ agendas in many countries, including many member states of UNIDO. However, substantial work remains ahead for governments, industry, the private sector, investors and organizations like UNIDO in order to effectively promote, support and accelerate the development of innovative clean technologies and solutions, especially in and for the industrial sector. <strong>Governments need to create ecosystems to identify innovative solutions for the technical challenges faced by industry and to work with industry and the broader research and development community to solve them</strong>.</p>
<p>Government support for green manufacturing, small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) innovation competitions, and incubators and accelerators for innovation has risen over the past few years. This is a very positive sign. UNIDO, together with key partners like the Global Environment Facility and the Cleantech Open, has been able to develop the UNIDO-GEF Global Cleantech Innovation Programme for SMEs, now covering seven countries and expected to be expanded to additional ones, to help unlock the full potential of energy efficiency in industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <strong>new area of focus</strong> for UNIDO in terms of innovation <strong>for industrial energy efficiency is Big Data and the Internet-of-Things</strong>. Recent reports from the McKinsey Global Institute have provided a very interesting insight into the potential for productivity and innovation that Big Data and the Internet-of-Things offer to industry. A study performed by one of Europe’s leading digital businesses has found that the implementation of information and communications technologies (ICT) and the digitizing of business processes can help remove 7.6 gigatonnes (GT) of carbon emissions across six industrial sectors, including 2.2 GT from utilities and 0.7 GT from manufacturing.[</p>
<p>Most companies are still capturing only a fraction of the potential value of data, analytics and ICT application, and the manufacturing sector is one of the sectors where progress has been particularly slow. Interestingly, the study also highlights the fact that the <strong>biggest barriers</strong> companies face in extracting value from data and analytics are organizational; many <strong>struggle to incorporate data-driven insights into day-to-day business processes. </strong></p>
<p>At UNIDO we have started to look at some of these opportunities and their associated barriers, and we are now working in several countries, including Russia and Iran, on the application of state-of-the-art internet-based solutions for energy efficiency analysis and monitoring in industry, allowing for instant tracking of energy performance and a real-time measurement of energy use and savings.</p>
<p><strong>Other innovative solutions</strong> that have very good potential for industrial energy efficiency include services related to <strong>remote monitoring and control of energy utilities</strong>, especially for SMEs, and <strong>automated systems to monitor and report on energy performance</strong>.&nbsp; Industrial companies and innovative entrepreneurs working in collaboration with the UNIDO industrial energy efficiency programme have experienced multiple benefits beyond pure energy cost savings, including increased productivity and competitiveness, reduced exposure to volatile energy prices and greater operational reliability. Yet, most countries still have substantial unrealized opportunities to improve their industrial energy efficiency. &nbsp;</p>

1087,"Industry, street lighting and district energy: Launch of new project to “unlock” access to financing",NULL,NULL,"<h3><strong>We need your technical knowledge: Help us “unlock” access to financing for industry, street lighting and district energy </strong></h3>
<p>The <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>Investor Confidence Project</strong> </a>was brought to Europe to develop a system to give confidence to all active stakeholders. There are still concerns that investing in energy efficiency is risky. ICP Europe is designed to change that. Starting with investments in buildings, ICP Europe is now broadening the scope to include industry (large and small), district energy and street lighting. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>The context is important &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The European Union is giving a high priority to sustainable energy through what is called the Energy Union. Improved energy efficiency is one of the pillars of the overall approach and it is well documented that we are not achieving our cost-effective potential for energy efficiency improvements. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a comprehensive policy framework that includes initiatives in all end-use sectors. Concerning the new expansion of ICP, the policy framework includes mandatory audits for large companies, promotion of energy efficiency in small and medium-sized enterprises, promotion of energy management (such as ISO 50001), encouraging the use of waste heat and support for cogeneration. The overall framework is currently going through a revision to increase the overall level of ambition. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission realises that it needs to get the energy efficiency market working more effectively in all sectors. Since the oil crises of the 1970s, there has been regular discussion about market barriers – why the potential for cost-effective energy efficiency improvements are not taking place. Policies that are put in place are now by and large designed to address one or more of those persistent barriers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission is also working through an open dialogue and work platform, the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.eefig.com/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group</a> (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/about/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes</a> is a member), to identify the barriers to the long-term financing for energy efficiency and propose policy and market solutions to them. The purpose of that group is to get the financial institutions and other relevant stakeholders to help find ways to overcome the financing blockage. There is financing available, banks have poor capacity and interest to finance energy efficiency and consumers (in this case industry or businesses or institutions) are reluctant to decide to undertake such measures. While there are some investments, for sure, they are not at a scale that will have a real impact that is needed to meet our long-term objectives. <strong>One of the problems is that there is a lack of standardisation in project development and documentation and that is seen as one of the major barriers to increasing investment into energy efficiency</strong>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For this reason, ICP plays an important role, as will be explained below. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Understanding the overall concept &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The concept of the Investor Confidence Project is relatively simple to understand. A potential project in a factory or a district energy system, for example, is identified. Someone has to do the necessary calculations to determine the viability. Someone has to be identified to install it (often the same organisation). And some organisation needs to fund it. What this project does is standardise the procedures so that all players gain confidence in the system. The factory owner is happy. The developer/auditor/installer is happy. The financial institution is happy. There are protocols in place and third party monitoring to ensure everything is done correctly. The protocols are developed by interested experts and not by commercial interests. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach, first brought out in the United States, was used for buildings, mainly multi-family and commercial buildings.&nbsp; This approach was then brought to Europe for buildings, funded through the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 programme. The final stages of the first phase on buildings are now being completed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission is now supporting a further evolution of the concept into industry, street lighting and district energy. This two-year project is just starting.&nbsp; It benefits from lessons learned in the buildings component because much of the methodology is similar. &nbsp; There are many elements in the process, but what is key now is the development of protocols that are used to establish a relationship between the client and the project developer (an ESCO, for example). &nbsp;</p>
<p>The protocol is quite technical but relates to the process, obviously with a good understanding of the technologies. <strong>This is why we need experts to help develop new protocols for industry, district energy and street lighting</strong>. The Energy Performance Protocols defines a standardised road map of best practices for originating energy retrofits following the ICP Project Lifecycle.&nbsp; ICP Protocols are an industry best practice assembly of existing standards, practices, and documentation in order to create the data necessary to enable underwriting or managing of energy performance risk.&nbsp; ICP Europe works with the <strong>European Technical Forum to develop protocols</strong> that are designed to address the range of typical industry (large and small), district energy and street lighting projects found in the European market. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These protocols reference international, European and national standards and best practices to provide all market actors across the European energy efficiency development and investment community with tools to improve the bankability of relevant energy efficiency projects projects. ? &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For that reason, ICP Europe needs technical experts who understand the European context in those areas. </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each defined protocol creates a standard set of documentation that will help standardise project performance underwriting, leading to better data on performance, and a more efficient marketplace with less duplicative engineering and lower transaction costs.&nbsp; The result should be an increase in deal flow and a more transparent and efficient market. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Joining the Technical Forum &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The Forum will ensure that ICP Europe staff is producing relevant and needed products and services for the European renovation markets. The Forum shall do this through:</p>
<ol> 	<li>Providing insight and feedback on draft products in webinar based Forum meetings and informally;</li> 	<li>Providing local, national and European knowledge on relevant standards, best practices and initiatives that may be relevant to, or interact with, ICP Europe products and tools and</li> 	<li>Identifying projects and programmes for piloting of ICP Europe products and services. &nbsp;</li> </ol>

<h3>Join and shape the future of energy efficiency markets</h3>
<p>One of the first steps is to create awareness and bring in experts on industry, street lighting and district energy to help develop protocols. This will get the process in motion.

<p>The typical utility model of the past is dead.</p>
<p>The rise of renewables is often mentioned as one of the key reasons. Giant utilities were and are operating assets worth billions which need to run at x% ongoingly for a duration af 20+ years, better 50 years.</p>
<p>Smart grids, distributed renewables production, climate change - all this has changed the landscape. Nevertheless, to change the strategy of such a giant is nothing you can do within a few month, not even years. Not talking about changing the entire culture. Only the real pressure from the unthinkable, bankruptcy, has in the meantime led to structral changes going on today.</p>
<h3>But we are likely only at the beginning</h3>
<p>In 2 earlier blogs, I referred to the reasons behind, see <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/articles/detailed-article/?article=100065&amp;cHash=33d4befc6b537b3ba1d3410d162d0233"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>Utility of the Future</strong></a> (based on a study from the MIT Energy Initiative) and <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/articles/detailed/eb21705a80ba846bf019b7cd0e950b9d/game-changers-in-the-energy-system/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>Game Changers in the Energy System</strong></a> (based on a whitepaper from World Economic Forum and McKinsey).</p>
<p>One of the key reasons/sources/opportunities for change is based on Digitilization, e.g. WEF/McKinsey call it one of the ""Deep global trends"". Whereas poeple tend to understand different things under Digitilization (big data, machine learning, automation, M2M, IoT, block chain technology, ...) there is one new development taking place which has kind of received some media coverage already: The collaborative model</p>
<h3>The collaborative model: energy communities</h3>
<p>Oliver Wyman used this phrase to describe the opportunity for utilities to engage with local or regional communities building open, transparent relationships. This approach is based on understanding (and treating) its consumers as energy producer. Think of all the households already having solar panels on their roofs. Block chain is the technology which seems to be best suited to organise such new partnerhsips (for details, check <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/articles/detailed/09c8c9c90bdffece8309b9ef7cddfe5b/blockchain-in-the-energy-sector-institutional-disruption/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Blockchain in the energy sector: Institutional disruption?</a>). But today, I would like to showcase a new model:</p>
<h3>NEW - the loyalty model: Consumer as a shopper</h3>



<p>A big threat for utilities is the easy way for consumers to change their electricty provider combined with the high customer dissatisfaction, especially in many European countries. Likely everyone knows from his own electricity bills how difficult they are to read. And this is most often the only link utilities have with their customers today!</p>
<p>Starting from a different perspective, a few years ago, two digital marketing entrepeneurs came up with a simple question: ""How to easily buy the most energy efficient products for your home"". And they build a new business model perfectly suited for utilities to develop loyalty models and even gain new clients. Intentionally I said ""develop"" loyalty models and not ""enhance"" them as I do believe this is something utilities really have to build from scratch (well, most of them).</p>
<p>The company behind is enervee.</p>
<p>Enervee built a data engine delivering an <strong>energy efficiency score</strong>.</p>
<p>And now think of the opportunities for utilities. Combined with available information about energy consumption and price this perfectly allow to calculate energy savings - hence ""your utility"" helps you to save energy and money. It can also link this to buying prices and show you what industry calls ""total cost of ownership"".</p>
<p>And it delivers an Amzon kind of consumer experience. Miles away from the old paper bill!</p>
<p>In the meantime, the biggest European energy company EDF has launched the enervee marketplace, called <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.electriscore-edf.fr/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">EDF Électriscore</a>. It covers three main features</p>

<p>(for more info, check <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://blog.enervee.com/enervee-announces-edf-as-its-latest-european-marketplace-client-ab36bba0692b"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">https://blog.enervee.com/enervee-announces-edf-as-its-latest-european-marketplace-client-ab36bba0692b)</a></p>
<p>According to enervee, ""<strong>consumers in Europe buy on average 19 energy-consuming products and appliances for their homes each year</strong>""</p>
<p>Or in other words 19 opportunities to build and increase loyalty!</p>

1089,"Blockchain in the energy sector: Institutional disruption?",NULL,NULL,"<h2>Blockchain &amp; Energy: The discussion is heating up</h2>

<p>This</p>
<p>post is about one of the hottest topics in energy business, the</p>
<p>blockchain. While there are many discussions already going on about the</p>
<p>technological dimension and business cases based on the new technology,</p>
<p>we –as usual – will focus on the institutional side again. Importantly,</p>
<p>we intend to sketch a first general picture of the potential</p>
<p>institutional implications of the blockchain technology in the energy</p>
<p>sector, thereby keeping in mind that the full potential, applicability</p>
<p>and success of this new technology is still uncertain.</p>
<p>On 14th February 2017 energy and blockchain experts met in Vienna on the <a href=""http://eventhorizon2017.com"" target=""_blank"">Event Horizon 2017</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;to</p>
<p>discuss the potential of the blockchain technology for the energy</p>
<p>sector. The general idea behind such events like the one in Vienna seems</p>
<p>to be very compelling: Can we apply a decentralized ledger technology</p>
<p>like the blockchain to a system that currently develops towards an</p>
<p>increasingly decentralized structure (due to the diffusion of renewable</p>
<p>electricity supply and new applications on the demand side, like</p>
<p>electric vehicles), like the electricity system? Today, blockchain is a</p>
<p>niche topic in energy business, with less than 2%&nbsp;of all startups</p>
<p>that focus on blockchain technology targeting specifically the energy</p>
<p>sector. However, the incumbent energy business becomes aware that</p>
<p>blockchain is an important topic with huge potential.</p>
<p>Now, if we</p>
<p>take a look at the debate on the Event Horizon, we see very passionate</p>
<p>people from different startups and a lot of enthusiasm. This is because</p>
<p>the blockchain is based on a very good selling idea: At low costs, it</p>
<p>uses a transparent distributed system that is based on democratic</p>
<p>processes and replaces less transparent intermediate services. These</p>
<p>three components (cost saving, transparency and democratic decision</p>
<p>making) are very compelling and are, at least from our point of view,</p>
<p>the main reason why blockchain gains some much audience at the moment.</p>
<p>Still, blockchain is in its infancy, with many obstacles to overcome</p>
<p>(for a more details see this <a href=""https://medium.com/@leecocking/9-things-i-learned-working-in-blockchain-for-24-months-cb64b8605780#.tas00jses"" target=""_blank"">post</a>).&nbsp;Especially on the technical side, the blockchain technology has yet to prove that it can meet the (very high) expectations. <a href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0163477"" target=""_blank"">Yli-Huumo et al. (2016)</a> give a nice overview of the current challenges for the blockchain technology:</p>

<ul> 	<li><strong>Throughput:</strong> Bitcoin network is currently maximized to 7tps (transactions per second). VISA (2,000 up to 48,000 tps) and Twitter (5,000tps)</li> 	<li><strong>Latency:</strong> To create sufficient security for a Bitcoin transaction block, it takes currently roughly 10 minutes to complete one transaction.</li> 	<li><strong>Size and bandwidth</strong>: size of a BitCoin Blockchain is over 50,000MB (February 2016). When the throughput increases to the levels of VISA, Blockchain could grow 214PB each year.</li> 	<li><strong>Security:</strong> The current Blockchain has a possibility of a 51% attack. In a 51% attack a single entity would have full control of the majority of the network’s mining hash-rate and would be able to manipulate Blockchain.</li> 	<li><strong>Wasted resources</strong>: Mining Bitcoin wastes huge amounts of energy ($15million/day).</li> 	<li><strong>Usability:</strong> The Bitcoin API for developing services is difficult to use. There is a need to develop a more developer-friendly API for Blockchain.</li> 	<li><strong>Versioning, hard forks, multiple chains: </strong>A small chain that consists of a small number of nodes has a higher possibility of a 51% attack. Another issue emerges when chains are split for administrative or versioning purposes.</li> </ul>

<p>From our perspective, especially the energy intensity is very interesting. <a href=""http://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/CDE+16.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Croman et al. (2016)</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;calculated</p>
<p>for BitCoin that the energy costs related to each transaction add up to</p>
<p>6.2$, given the current design of BitCoin (1 MB per block, latency of</p>
<p>10 minutes). For the future, Croman et al. (2016) project that these</p>
<p>costs could be cut by 80% with larger block size (4 MB) and higher</p>
<p>latency (12 seconds).</p>
<p>So at this point, we can conclude that the blockchain is a promising technology, but far from being ready for the mass market.</p>

<h2>The Blockchain: A brief introduction</h2>

<p>In</p>
<p>a nutshell, the blockchain is a distributed, digital peer-to-peer</p>
<p>register, which stores every transaction between two connected agents in</p>
<p>a ledger. This ledger is distributed globally on all connected nodes.</p>
<p>This distributed data set consists of a collection of historic data</p>
<p>about all transactions made. Each transaction is added to the dataset as</p>
<p>a new block (in a linear and chronological order), which results in a</p>
<p>full record of all transactions made between two parties. As each</p>
<p>connected note carries the same data set, algorithms can be used on each</p>
<p>computer to verify transactions. If you want to know more about the</p>
<p>technical details you can take a deep dive <a href=""https://bitsonblocks.net/2015/09/09/a-gentle-introduction-to-blockchain-technology/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, many different blockchains pop up. Basically, we can differentiate these chains using two criteria:</p>

<ol> 	<li>Supervision and control: Is there an institution that controls the blockchain (e.g. decides who joins a blockchain, can delete or alter the data set in the ledger)?</li> 	<li>Visibility: Either a blockchain is public and thereby visible for everyone or private and therefore only visible to the members of the blockchain.</li> </ol>

<p>Today, most blockchains are</p>
<p>public permissionless ledgers, i.e. there is no central supervision of</p>
<p>the ledger and the responsibility to manage the system is with its</p>
<p>users. With permissionless blockchains, everyone can connect to the</p>
<p>blockchain and use it for transactions.</p>
<p>Figure 1: The difference between private and public blockchains</p>











<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""292"" height=""204"" src=""fileadmin/_processed_/c/3/csm_161_men_women_view_think_web_714aa67d59.jpg"" width=""307"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>


<p>The</p>
<p>public blockchain uses a public and distributed ledger to verify</p>
<p>transactions. If there needs to be an adaptation of the public</p>
<p>blockchain, this requires in most cases consensus (or at least majority)</p>
<p>decisions by all users. On the other hand, one institution or a group</p>
<p>of institutions supervises a private and commissioned blockchain. Access</p>
<p>to the private blockchain is restricted, verification is based on the</p>
<p>private blockchain and the hosting institution is responsible for the</p>
<p>management of the blockchain ledger. Figure 2 gives a first overview of</p>
<p>prominent examples for permission and permissionless public and private</p>
<p>blockchains. Obviously, a permissionless private blockchain is a</p>
<p>theoretical construct. So far, this approach has not been used in the</p>
<p>real world.</p>

<p>The blockchain might change or even disrupt many sectors as it challenges the business case of intermediaries. <a href=""http://www.ponton.de/downloads/mm/Potential-of-the-Blockchain-Technology-in-Energy-Trading_Merz_2016.en.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Merz (2016)</a></p>
<p>here refers to “disintermediation”. So far, many business models are</p>
<p>based on the fact that two parties that want to execute a transaction do</p>
<p>not have enough information about each other to process the</p>
<p>transaction.</p>
<p>In different markets, disintermediation has been an</p>
<p>issue for retailers due to new digital platform providers, e.g. amazon,</p>
<p>Uber and AirBnB <a href=""http://www.ponton.de/downloads/mm/Potential-of-the-Blockchain-Technology-in-Energy-Trading_Merz_2016.en.pdf"" target=""_blank"">(Merz 2016)</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the blockchain technology offers the potential to substitute</p>
<p>service of intermediates in more than just the retail business.</p>

<h3>What’s in it for the energy sector</h3>

<p>Expectations</p>
<p>are that private as well as public blockchains can significantly alter</p>
<p>the electricity sector if the underlying blockchain technology proves</p>
<p>successful. In <a href=""https://www.dena.de/fileadmin/dena/Dokumente/Meldungen/dena_ESMT_Studie_blockchain_englisch.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Burger et al. &nbsp;(2016)</a>,</p>
<p>experts from the incumbent energy business identify the largest</p>
<p>potential of the blockchain in retail business. Especially Peer-2-Peer</p>
<p>trading offers an interesting potential for the electricity sector.</p>

<p>The</p>
<p>Brooklyn MicroGrid project by LO3 Inc. as well as Power Ledger</p>
<p>activities in Australia nicely illustrate the potential of blockchain</p>
<p>for local p2p trade based on the blockchain technology. In these</p>
<p>projects decentralized energy providers (households with PV) sell</p>
<p>locally produced electricity to their neighbours via blockchain. The</p>
<p>combined processing of transactions of physical energy and financial</p>
<p>resources seems to be a very promising application for the blockchain</p>
<p>technology. However, these projects go beyond retail. They show us the</p>
<p>potential of blockchain technology to operate the grid based on a</p>
<p>decentralized ledger technology. If we imagine that most devices that</p>
<p>are connected to the electricity grid have access to the same</p>
<p>blockchain, it seems possible that these devices autonomously coordinate</p>
<p>(e.g. via smart contracts) their electricity production or consumption</p>
<p>not only according to market signals, but to stabilise the distribution</p>
<p>grid. <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?htmlfid=GBE03620USEN"" target=""_blank"">IBM (2015)</a> uses the term “device democracy” to describe the autonomous coordinate between devices via the blockchain.</p>
<p>Given</p>
<p>the assumption that the autonomous coordination between the electric</p>
<p>devices actually works (meaning that enough transactions per second are</p>
<p>possible etc.), we can imagine that the blockchain reduces the</p>
<p>complexity related to network operation. For example, the DSO could</p>
<p>operate a (private) permissioned blockchain and all devices that are</p>
<p>connected to the DSOs electricity grids have to use this blockchain to</p>
<p>track transactions. This would give the DSO the power not only to</p>
<p>supervise, but to intervene into the processes in the blockchain in case</p>
<p>of emergencies. If the stability of the grid is challenged (even if</p>
<p>smart contracts are working), the DSO could either use automated</p>
<p>processes to secure grid stability (which he can do in any blockchain,</p>
<p>private or public), or even stronger measures (resets, stop transactions</p>
<p>or “hard fork” i.e. delete all transactions for a certain period).</p>

<h3>The institutional implications of the application of blockchain in the energy sector</h3>

<p>If</p>
<p>the blockchain proves to be applicable in the energy sector, we can</p>
<p>expect this to have significant effects. Obviously, the degree to which</p>
<p>the blockchain might or might not change the energy sector strongly</p>
<p>depends on the specific applications of the blockchain, the regulatory</p>
<p>framework and many other aspects. Due to the early stage in the</p>
<p>development of blockchain technology, it is not possible (at least for</p>
<p>us), to foresee if and how exactly this technology will change the</p>
<p>energy business. Some important changes, however, seem foreseeable.</p>

<h3><em>Blockchain can alter the role model in the energy sector</em></h3>

<p>We</p>
<p>identify a significant potential of blockchain to change the role</p>
<p>concept in the electricity sector.&nbsp;Therefore, we speak of institutional</p>
<p>disruption in the title.&nbsp;Some of the existing roles in the electricity</p>
<p>supply chain might become obsolete (Do we still need retailers if all</p>
<p>data is exchanged directly between the electricity producer and the</p>
<p>consumer?), new roles and tasks might evolve and some business cases and</p>
<p>roles might not be affected by blockchain applications at all (Does the</p>
<p>Blockchain change the electricity generation business case?).</p>

<h3><em>How the blockchain could alter the role of retailers</em></h3>

<p>Most</p>
<p>prominently, the blockchain technology has the potential to influence</p>
<p>the retail business. The degree to how the blockchain might alter the</p>
<p>retail business can vary significantly. First, retailers could make use</p>
<p>of the blockchain technology to increase the efficiency of their</p>
<p>business by cutting costs. This application of the blockchain would be</p>
<p>comparable to the current developments in the finance sector, where the</p>
<p>incumbent financial institutions apply the blockchain technology to</p>
<p>their established products to reduce costs. While this might offer new</p>
<p>business opportunities in the retail sector, from an institutional</p>
<p>perspective, the blockchain technology would not change much. Rather, we</p>
<p>could expect institutional implications if retail becomes an autonomous</p>
<p>application sold together with generation assets (like PV), storages or</p>
<p>consumption devices. As a consequence, retail business would be</p>
<p>substituted by autonomous smart contracts that are provided together</p>
<p>with generation or consumption devices.</p>

<h3><em>How blockchain could alter the role of (distribution) grid operators</em></h3>

<p>Let’s</p>
<p>suppose that network operation is based on smart contracts or other</p>
<p>autonomous processes that secure frequency and voltage control as well</p>
<p>as balancing. These autonomous processes might trigger a discussion</p>
<p>about responsibilities: The higher the degree of automation and the</p>
<p>higher the number of autonomous devices (generation and consumption)</p>
<p>that can provide network services, the lower is the need for</p>
<p>supervision. This might lead to the question how many network operators</p>
<p>are required and whether the responsibility for network stability could</p>
<p>be centralized or even completely decentralized. Such a development</p>
<p>would result in a new “market structure” on the network level with</p>
<p>either a very high concentration (with just one network operator) or a</p>
<p>very fragmented structure with very decentralized network operators</p>
<p>(potentially on the consumer level).</p>
<p>This might in turn require an adaptation of the institutional design as well, e.g. the way we regulate the network operators.</p>

<h3><em>How the blockchain could alter regulation of network operators</em></h3>

<p>Concerning regulation, the blockchain might offer the potential to simplify the process of regulation and increase efficiency. <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/8090cc80-fff6-11e5-99cb-83242733f755"" target=""_blank"">Giancarlo (2016)</a>&nbsp;speaks</p>
<p>of the opportunity for regulators to get access to the golden record,</p>
<p>the real-time ledger(s) of all regulated participants (if the regulated</p>
<p>entities make use of the blockchains and the regulator has access to</p>
<p>them). Then, the regulator would become able to analyse and understand</p>
<p>all processes the regulated entities are involved in.</p>
<p>To apply the</p>
<p>idea of the “golden record” to the energy sector could alter</p>
<p>regulation, for example of the distribution grid operators, to a</p>
<p>significant extent. As described above, the network operators could use</p>
<p>(private or public commissioned) blockchains to operate their network.</p>
<p>For all those transaction that are executed via the blockchain, the</p>
<p>regulator could gain full transparency by connecting to the blockchain.</p>
<p>Furthermore,</p>
<p>the blockchain could simplify the interaction between the regulator and</p>
<p>the regulated entities. For example, an increased transparency for the</p>
<p>regulator via the blockchain about the DSOs activities could change the</p>
<p>way network operators can manage their grids. Here, current discussions</p>
<p>in Europe focus on the question whether and how the DSO could use</p>
<p>flexibility provided by market parties to increase the feed-in of RES.</p>
<p>From the regulator’s perspective, the network operator’s interaction</p>
<p>with market parties increases the risk of market distortions, at least</p>
<p>as long as network operators are not fully unbundled from the</p>
<p>competitive businesses in generation and retail <a href=""http://www.ceer.eu/portal/page/portal/EER_HOME/EER_PUBLICATIONS/CEER_PAPERS/Cross-Sectoral/Tab1/C15-DSO-16-03_DSO%20Conclusions_13%20July%202015.pdf"" target=""_blank"">(CEER 2015)</a>.</p>
<p>Such</p>
<p>reservations by the regulator are primarily driven by the missing</p>
<p>transparency of company-internal as well as market processes. The</p>
<p>blockchain technology might provide the necessary transparency to the</p>
<p>regulator, which could drive the regulator to allow the DSO to interact</p>
<p>with the market (e.g. based on smart contracts) in the blockchain. Then,</p>
<p>the DSO might be able to more efficiently integrate RES, i.e. at lower</p>
<p>costs than today. Furthermore, less information asymmetry might reduce</p>
<p>the need for further unbundling of DSOs if they want to interact more</p>
<p>closely with market parties.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>
<p>As</p>
<p>discussed above, the introduction of blockchains could trigger some</p>
<p>institutional changes in the electricity sector. These institutional</p>
<p>changes could affect both, the retail and the network sector. We could</p>
<p>move towards a world where generators directly sell electricity to the</p>
<p>customers, which results in a stronger integration of generation and</p>
<p>retail business. Potentially, retail won’t remain an independent part of</p>
<p>the supply chain, but an automated and autonomous process conducted by</p>
<p>the generators and consumers themselves. Furthermore, the “golden</p>
<p>record” idea by <a href=""http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opagiancarlo-15"" target=""_blank"">Giancarlo (2016a)</a></p>
<p>provides a basis to reduce information asymmetry between the regulator</p>
<p>and the network operators, potentially leading to more unbundling than</p>
<p>is the status quo.</p>

1090,"Here’s How European Energy Companies See The (Near) Future",NULL,NULL,"<h2>Here’s How European Energy Companies See The (Near)&nbsp;Future</h2>
<p><em>Two days at Europe’s premier energy conference, eurelectric 2017, reveal how utilities are rapidly adjusting — and looking forward- to a new era of opportunity.</em></p>
<p>Two days in what feels like the Lisbon executive’s weekend get-away of choice, Estoril, have revealed a pretty consistent view of how European power companies see their future. It’s been the annual eurelectric conference, and against a backdrop of old European grandeur (coupled with — I’m pleased to say — two Tesla destination chargers within 20m of the hotel entrance), the discussions have been diverse, detailed and unequivocally optimistic.</p>
<p>Away from the day-job of working with energy retailers at the consumer level, it was a surprise to hear these companies talk so excitedly about the potential — the centrality — of electrification in delivering on a carbon-free future. At the consumer level we’re used to the concerns regarding high consumer churn, disruptive new entrants, diminishing margins and races to the bottom. But here, the talk was almost exclusively of upside, the potential of energy providers, and the role of digitalisation in unlocking that potential. As one panel member pointed out in the closing session ‘our business is fast become as much about data, as it is about electrons.’</p>
<p>Having listened to every keynote and panel from start to finish, here are the five key take-aways from eurelectric 2017:</p>
<h3>1. Hear that sound? That’s what an industry sounds like when turning 180&nbsp;degrees.</h3>
<p>This was unmissable. The energy industry is focused on a new era of opportunity. Three years ago, less than half of delegates of this conference saw an opportunity in decarbonisation. For this 2017 event, that number has climbed to over 80%. And it’s important to stress the high calibre of attendees at eurelectric makes this number even more astonishing. These are the key decision-makers in the industry getting behind the opportunity. Much of this optimism rests on the potential of decentralisation of generation and distribution, as well as storage, both of which we’ll come back to. But the commitment to placing European power companies at the heart of innovation in meeting the electrification of our societies was clear. This is no longer a nervous industry in retreat, this is an industry looking to win.</p>
<h3>2. Elon has a hill to&nbsp;climb.</h3>
<p>This is an interesting one for us, here at Enervee — not only because many of us are noisy advocates for what Tesla is achieving, but also because our lead product, Marketplace, will soon have a sibling in the form of Autovee. So this take-away gets a little more space in our list!</p>
<p>Michael Liebreich of research company Bloomberg New Energy Finance put the challenge in front of Tesla in very clear terms. In short, Tesla’s production capability needs to increase exponentially over the next six quarters in order to meet targets. This means 350,000 Model 3s alone need to be delivered in 2018, representing over 75% of all Tesla car sales in the year. That equates to a ramp-up in production that is twice as steep as aircraft production during WWII. A far more poetic and salient historical comparison is this: production of the Model 3 in 2018 needs to match that of the Model T in 1910. There couldn’t be a more fitting illustration in terms of the birth and re-birth of an industry.</p>
<p>But production alone is not the only EV headache. Laszlo Varro from the IEA illustrated the challenge inherent in having millions of people plugging in their EVs when getting back home: uncoordinated charging patterns. With almost everyone’s car being parked up overnight between the return from the office and the next day’s commute, people will habitually charge overnight, both for convenience and a sense that power is at its cheapest, due to lower demand. But this second argument is fast becoming a false argument, as renewables, and particularly solar, become a larger component of the energy mix. Now, overnight charging doesn’t necessarily equate with a lower kWh price. Recognising that a car is, on average, parked for 20hrs a day is the opportunity to bring the charging process into line with supply dynamics without, crucially, interfering with consumer ease (which all recognised is a red-line for widespread EV adoption). Smarter charging technology and infrastructure can solve this?—?from dynamic distribution in high charge density urban areas that adjust charge point power to regulate and remove load on the grid, through to consumer apps to nudge towards better charging times at home, based on dynamic tariffs. Plus bi-directional charging (V2x) already seen in Japan (ChaDeMo standard) opens up the opportunity to offer reserves to market via an EV (via automated Frequency Containment Reserve functionality on the car). One European provider working on all of this is Virta from Finland, a company founded by 18 Finnish utility companies: check <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://youtu.be/YPdI0YB90Ss"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">https://youtu.be/YPdI0YB90Ss</a></p>

<h3>3. Not in my back&nbsp;yard</h3>
<p>Virta, introduced above, also offers the opportunity for those who have EV home charging points to make them available to others in their local community to earn revenue. These distributed and community-level networks were heavily discussed, with a clear focus on the consumer benefit, such as&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://brooklynmicrogrid.com/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Brooklyn Microgrid</a>.</p>
<p>Micro-grids make superb sense for the homeowner — both financially and socially. But a key question came up in this community-level conversation: if members of a community are increasingly reliant on a microgrid for both consumption and generation, what responsibility do those community members have to continue to pay towards the servicing and upkeep of the wider grid, in which the microgrid sits? There was no clear answer for this, but it highlighted a fundamental challenge within the micro/off-grid utopia that many espouse with the set-up: at some point, near-frictionless convenience needs to be paid for. A parallel can be drawn between these endeavours and the more established platform disruptors such as Airbnb and Uber where unintended friction consequences can crop-up — for those on either side of the platform.</p>
<h3>4. Have you met my&nbsp;twin?</h3>
<p>On the heels of electrification as the word of the conference, was digitisation. Much of the discussion around opportunity focused on the role of digitisation in unlocking that opportunity. Incoming eurelectic president, Francesco Starace, discussed how ENEL was dramatically improving the performance of its power plants — all power plants — through digitising its operations functions, and GE Power’s Ganesh Bell went further to show how creating digital twins of power plant assets allowed operators to better understand, predict and optimise those assets. Whilst what Bell called the ‘Internet of Big and Important Things’ has no immediate impact on Enervee and its consumer-facing proposition, it does potentially show an increasing appreciation and appetite within the industry for the diagnostic and predictive power of good data coupled with strong analysis. Nowhere can this advantage be leveraged more than with a better understanding of not just energy customers, but consumers in general.</p>
<h3>5. The&nbsp;Future?</h3>
<p>The key polling stat on how delegates see the immediate future for the industry is already quoted: 80% seeing deep decarbonisation as an opportunity. But it’s worth noting a couple of other results from the polling run during the event:</p>
<ul> 	<li><strong>50% of attendees believe digitisation and technology will be the biggest single enabler of market transformation (the No1 response), with 41% (No2) believing in new regulation for innovation.</strong></li> 	<li><strong>31% of attendees see the value in a decarbonised power system for utilities being found in new services and retail (second only to 42% seeing long-term value in distribution).</strong></li> </ul>

<p><em>Both of these results are important for Enervee, as they point to the growing recognition and appetite from the very top of utilities to offer enhanced, digitally-based, services to consumers.</em></p>
<p>But our last comment is a little more cautious. At one point in the event, an audience member asked a panel of CEOs (four, no less) if — in this new era of customer-centricity for utilities — they feared being disrupted by the large tech and retail companies, such as Google, Apple or Amazon. The response was that these tech and retail companies don’t understand the industry, and what it takes to deliver the service. One CEO claimed ‘Google may be good in the digital space, but do they understand our world? No. Would they be willing to put boots on the ground to solve problems? I don’t think so.’</p>
<p>The room was a little more quiet in response to this. Despite the opportunity, it’s likely the industry will not want to take its collective eye of these companies just yet. After all, these are the companies that know all too well how a compelling digital experience can up-turn an industry, and change the way we all behave.</p>
<p>Enervee is the world’s first software-as-a-service company that combines data science, behavioral science and digital marketing to drive consumer energy saving and engagement, by transforming the way we buy. Enervee products include Marketplace, Charge, Home and Insight. The company is headquartered in Venice, CA, with offices in Germany and the UK.</p>

1092,"C-level: New approach to safeguard energy efficiency investments",NULL,NULL,"<h3>Industry is starting to get some answers &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Since the oil crises in the 1970s, industry has been treated specially, although not always in ways that led to important improvements in energy performance. There is no need to repeat the history of stop-start energy efficiency policy. The context has significantly changed since most global leaders importantly agreed on the Paris climate agreement in December 2015. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In Europe, most of the policy support was through the Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) but it is obvious that, whatever the impact, it has not led to improvements in energy efficiency.&nbsp; In 2012, the EU approved the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) that led to measures related to mandatory audits for large companies, promotion of energy management systems (such as ISO 50001), encouraging support for SMEs as well as encouraging the better use of waste heat.&nbsp; Cogeneration was also integrated into the EED. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While the EED is going through further revision, there are no legislative changes to support energy efficiency in industry. The European Commission wants the market to work more effective. But, there is important support.</p>
<ul> 	<li>For one, the <strong>Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG)</strong> was created to overcome some of the financial barriers that have been identified in all sectors. Rightly, that includes the industrial sector, for both large industry as well as medium and smaller companies.&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Now the European Commission has tried to further address financial barriers by funding a two-year project entitled the <strong>Investor Confidence Project for Industry, District Energy and Street Lighting</strong>. This project follows a similar one, in terms of methodology, that is almost completed for buildings.</li> </ul>
<h3>Senior management needs to understand the benefits of the scheme. &nbsp;</h3>
<p>First let’s look at the problems (barriers) it is trying to address. Then, let us see what ICP has to offer to address some of those issues. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes is a member), identifies the barriers to the long-term financing for energy efficiency and proposes policy and market solutions to them. The purpose of that group is to get the financial institutions and other relevant stakeholders to help find ways to overcome the financing blockage. There is financing available, but banks have poor capacity and interest to finance energy efficiency and consumers (in this case industry or businesses or institutions) are often reluctant to decide to undertake such measures. <strong>Possible energy and related financial savings are often seen as hard to predict with the effect that such investment proposals fail internally</strong>.</p>
<p>And while there are some investments, for sure, they are not at a scale that will have a real impact that is needed to meet our long-term objectives.</p>
<p>One of the problems is that there is a <strong>lack of standardisation in project development and documentation</strong> and that is seen as a major barrier to increasing investment into energy efficiency. &nbsp; For this reason, ICP plays an important role, as will be explained below. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Understanding the overall concept &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The concept of the Investor Confidence Project is relatively simple to understand.</p>
<p>Typical steps of an energy efficiency project:</p>
<ol> 	<li>A potential project in a factory or a district energy system, for example, is identified.</li> 	<li>Someone has to do the necessary calculations to determine the viability.</li> 	<li>Someone has to be identified to install it (often the same organisation).</li> 	<li>And some organisation (or group of organisations) needs to fund it.</li> </ol>
<p>What this project does is <strong>standardise the procedures so that all players gain confidence</strong> in the system.</p>
<ul> 	<li>The factory owner is happy.</li> 	<li>The developer/auditor/installer is happy.</li> 	<li>The financial institution is happy.</li> </ul>

<p>There are protocols in place and third party monitoring to ensure everything is done correctly. The protocols are developed by interested experts and not by commercial interests. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach, first brought out in the United States, was used for buildings, mainly multi-family and commercial buildings.&nbsp; This approach was then brought to Europe for buildings, funded through the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 programme. The final stages of the first phase on buildings are now being completed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission is now supporting a further extension of the concept into industry, street lighting and district energy. This two-year project has just starting.&nbsp; It benefits from lessons learned in the buildings component because much of the methodology is similar. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many elements in the process, but what is key now is the development of protocols that are used to establish a relationship between the consumer and the project developer (an ESCO, for example). &nbsp;</p>
<p>The certification process is shown below. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""299"" height=""350"" src=""fileadmin/_processed_/e/d/csm_FINAL_slider_77bd62c57a.png"" width=""664"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p>For management in industry, the protocols are fundamental to set the foundation of a strong relationship that is show in in the above process. ICP Protocols are an industry best practice assembly of existing standards, practices, and documentation in order to create the data necessary to enable underwriting or managing of energy performance risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For <strong>company management the protocol is a safeguard of the process</strong> because it specifically lays out all the elements that process.&nbsp; The project developer goes through a certification procedure and once the project is complete there is third-party independent verification. This gives comfort to the company management and it allays the concerns of the financial institution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a need to seriously ramp up implementation of cost-effective measures in industry. This process will work. Now it has to be further tested on industry so that there is commercial roll out by the end of the two-year project. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope you will give it good consideration. In the past year, large industry has had to have a mandatory audit.&nbsp; Potential projects have been identified. Many other companies of all sizes also have a good idea of what they would like to implement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, there is more than one way to support the financing of energy efficiency measures in industry. But, to meet our Paris climate obligations, the overall level of ambition needs to seriously ramp up.

1093,"36 Emerging Technologies for Energyefficiency and GHG Emissions Reduction in the Pulp and Paper Industry",NULL,NULL,"<p>The pulp and paper industry accounted for approximately 5 percent of total industrial final energy consumption and 2 percent of direct carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the industrial sector worldwide (IEA 2011). (Note: Direct CO2 emissions are emissions from fossil fuel use and chemical reactions produced onsite and do not include emissions associated with purchased steam and electricity.) World paper and paperboard demand and production are increasing; annual production is expected to grow from approximately 365 million tonnes (Mt) in 2006 to between 700 Mt (low estimate) and 900 Mt (high estimate) in 2050. The largest share of this growth will take place in China, India, and other developing countries (see Figure below). This significant increase in paper production will cause a corresponding significant increase in the pulp and paper industry’s absolute energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.</p>

<p>Studies have documented the potential to save energy by implementing commercially-available energy-efficiency technologies and measures in the pulp and paper industry worldwide. However, today, given the projected continuing increase in absolute paper production, future reductions (e.g., by 2030 or 2050) in absolute energy use and CO2 emissions will require further innovation in this industry. Innovations will likely include development of different processes and materials for paper production or technologies that can economically capture and store the industry’s CO2 emissions. The development of these emerging technologies and their deployment in the market will be a key factor in the pulp and paper industry’s mid- and long-term climate change mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>Many studies from around the world have identified sector-specific and cross- energy-efficiency technologies for the pulp and paper industry that have already been commercialized (See figure below). However, information is scarce and scattered regarding emerging or advanced energy-efficiency and low-carbon technologies for the pulp and paper industry that have not yet been commercialized.</p>

1094,"How ICP can contribute to the success of energy efficiency networks",NULL,NULL,"<h2>How ICP can contribute to the success of energy efficiency networks &nbsp; &nbsp;</h2>
<p>Very few of us in our work lives can work in a vacuum. There is a need to bounce ideas back and forth; there is a need to test our opinions. There is also a need to learn from the experience of others. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is equally true for managers and technicians when we plan for improving the energy performance of our businesses. Since the oil crises of the 1970s, there have been efforts to bring together staff from industry to discuss problems and solutions to improving energy efficiency. There have been organised initiatives and informal approaches but there was an understanding that these experts – those who work with complex machinery and systems daily – were key to improvements in industrial energy efficiency. <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes</a> has been working with industry for many years to open the dialogue and create the right environment for more investment in energy efficiency.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>One important way of improving dialogue is through what are known as energy efficiency networks. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Understanding Energy Efficiency Networks &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://ipeec.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">IPEEC</a>), based in Paris, recently published a report a <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://ipeec.org/upload/publication_related_language/pdf/636.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window""><strong>report on energy efficiency networks</strong></a>. It is a concept that has been going from strength to strength in recent years. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Much of the potential for cost-effective improvements remains untapped, as the report confirms. It states: “Realising energy efficient solutions in industry is often hindered by decision routines, prioritisation of core business areas, lack of specific knowledge and market overview, and high transaction cost. There is also a lack of communication, exchange of experiences and knowledge.” The last sentence on communication is key. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For those of you who do not know about energy efficiency networks (EENs), they are peer-to-peer business-to-business networks that have been designed to overcome identified barriers and tap into the energy efficiency potential in the industrial sector. While there were other attempts earlier, the EEN concept started in Switzerland in the 1980s. The concept has now spread to many countries. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the main proponents today, Eberhard Jochem, from the Fraunhofer Institute and the Swiss Federal Institute for Technology, said, “Energy efficiency networks are about [often unknown] opportunities, trust and knowledge”. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Benefits of Energy Efficiency Networks &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The IPEEC report details many benefits of EENs:</p>
<ul> 	<li>Raising awareness for energy efficiency potentials and capacity building</li> 	<li>Reducing energy costs</li> 	<li>Improving productivity and competitiveness through enhanced product quality and reducing production rejects</li> 	<li>Increasing market shares of energy efficient solutions and related services&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Networking</li> 	<li>Fostering innovation.</li> 	<li>Creating new market dynamics in energy services</li> 	<li>Increasing transparency about energy use and data</li> 	<li>Ensuring compliance with legal requirements</li> 	<li>Contributing to national and global climate policy</li> 	<li>Catalysing international knowledge transfer &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p>There is no single definition amongst countries that have such networking, although the German model (based on the Swiss approach) has gained considerable interest and is getting strong backing from government. This has been followed by similar ones in Norway and Sweden, amongst others. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The IPEEC report explains how they have evolved, how companies pay to participate, how governments have taken an active role in setting them up. &nbsp; While we will come back to discuss them more in the future, the important point is that they bring people together to discuss common problems and to find innovative solutions. They are part technical and part management. They cover issues related to financing including ensuring confidence and de-risking. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Investor Confidence Project &nbsp;</h3>
<p>This latter point is important as organisations such as EEIP work with partners to establish a credible approach to confidence building [<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">http://europe.eeperformance.org/</a>] to ensure significantly more investments in industrial energy efficiency. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is behind the abbreviation “ICP” in the headline. ICP stand for Investor Confidence Project. The aim of this EU co-funded project is to support e.g. energy efficiency networks when it comes to the implementation of energy efficiency projects and the need to finance them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>ICP is currently developing easy to apply industry protocols allowing to standardise the process of documentation of such projects. This is reducing the requirements for technical expertise on the financial side (banks, investment funds etc) to assess such projects. Finally leading to easier and cheaper access to capital. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Call to join Technical Forum &nbsp;</h3>
<p>To develop such protocols, we are obviously relying on the input from energy efficiency experts such as the energy efficiency networks. Therefore, we would like to invite you to join our Technical Forum to review and comment on the development. &nbsp;</p>
<p>First drafts will be send around in September 2017 – so there is still time to join. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you are interested, please just register via <a href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/technical-forum.html"">http://europe.eeperformance.org/technical-forum.html</a> You can also contact me anytime under <a href=""mailto:Rod.Janssen@ee-ip.org"">Rod.Janssen@ee-ip.org</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, let’s keep talking.&nbsp; We have a lot to do. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

1095,"2 non-legislative EU initiatives for industrial energy efficiency",NULL,NULL,"<h2>2 non-legislative EU initiatives for industrial energy efficiency</h2>
<p>The industrial energy efficiency community was downcast late last year after the European Commission published its clean energy proposals. There were no legislative proposals related to industry and little attention given to the sector overall. In fact the Commission’s impact assessments show that the highest cuts in energy demand are projected to take place in the residential and tertiary sectors while the industry sector is projected to achieve the lowest reductions in energy demand.[1] This is particularly true for energy-intensive industries.[2] &nbsp;</p>
<p>In some ways, this lack of attention becomes an advantage. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2012 Energy Efficiency Directive had a few measures that were directly for industry – mandatory audits for large industry, promotion of energy management systems, support for SMEs and promotion of the use of waste heat, to name the main ones. The Commission could have built on those for the recent changes but did not. We will never fully understand why. The Commission certainly wants its Emissions Trading Scheme to be the main driver for improvements in large industry but it is well understood that, regardless of what success EU ETS has had, it has not driven improvements in energy efficiency. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But this is not to mean that industry is completely neglected. There are two initiatives that deserve our attention and that give us hope for significant impact. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes is a member), to identify the barriers to the long-term financing for energy efficiency and propose policy and market solutions to them. The purpose of that group is to get the financial institutions and other relevant stakeholders to help find ways to overcome the financing blockage. There is financing available, banks have poor capacity and interest to finance energy efficiency and consumers (in this case industry or businesses or institutions) are reluctant to decide to undertake such measures. While there are some investments, for sure, they are not at a scale that will have a real impact that is needed to meet our long-term objectives. One of the problems is that there is a lack of standardisation in project development and documentation and that is seen as one of the major barriers to increasing investment into energy efficiency. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Its 2015 final report provided important recommendations on industrial energy efficiency to policy makers: &nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li>The policy framework should positively support strong corporate energy efficiency investment choices at key points in their investment cycle</li> 	<li>Public resources and facilitation should be engaged to establish dynamic and effective systems for sharing information and technical experience</li> 	<li>Ensure EU and national policies and resources are working effectively together to drive R&amp;D and optimal energy efficiency outcomes</li> 	<li>Support the clarification of the regulatory, fiscal and accounting treatment and standardisation of Energy Performance Contracts</li> 	<li>Energy efficiency opportunity identification and investible project pipelines should be supported with Project Development Assistance facilities for SMEs &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p>Are we satisfied with the results to date?&nbsp; No, but we are starting to see some action but a couple of these recommendations are addressed by projects such as the Investor Confidence Project that will be discussed below. &nbsp;</p>
<p>First, it is important to note that EEFIG will be organising an event in October in Brussels on industrial energy efficiency.&nbsp; This will be an opportunity for the industrial energy efficiency community to raise its voice to EU institutions and other relevant stakeholders. You will hear more in the near future. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Investor Confidence Project for Industry, District Energy and Street Lighting &nbsp;</h3>

<p>The <em>Investor Confidence Project</em> was brought to Europe to develop a system to give confidence to all active stakeholders. There are still concerns that investing in energy efficiency is risky. ICP is designed to change that. ICP started with investments in buildings and is now broadening the scope to include industry, district energy and street lighting through a two-year project funded by the European Commission. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of ICP is relatively simple to understand. A potential project in a factory or a district heating system, for example, is identified. Someone has to do the necessary calculations to determine the viability. Someone has to be identified to install it (often the same organisation). And some organisation needs to fund it. What this project does is standardise the procedures so that all players gain confidence in the system. The factory owner is happy. The developer/auditor/installer is happy. The financial institution is happy. There are protocols in place and third party monitoring to ensure everything is done correctly. The protocols are developed by interested experts and not by commercial interests. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The project will work with all of those involved in the project cycle from owners through to project developers and verifiers. They all have a key role to play.&nbsp; To ensure that the protocols are robust, technical forums are being set up to review the draft protocols and provide important technical input to their development. &nbsp;</p>
<p>ICP was funded by the European Commission in part to address the recommendations that EEFIG identified.&nbsp; It is important that we design the entire certification process to the satisfaction of all stakeholders. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For <strong>owners or managers</strong>, the ICP approach will provide transparency of the process and will give them the confidence in implementing the measures. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For the <strong>project developer</strong>, ICP provides a process that is understood and accepted by all participants. This will reduce transaction costs and should minimise any misunderstandings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the <strong>financial community</strong>, the ICP approach will standardise the project development process and bring the necessary confidence to undertake the investments. &nbsp;</p>

1096,"The Pitfalls of LED Linear Tubes and Smart Lighting Systems",NULL,NULL,"<p>from Wesley Whited, DNV GL<br /> &nbsp;</p>
<h1>The Pitfalls of LED Linear Tubes and Smart Lighting Systems</h1>

<p>At first glance, retrofitting an existing fluorescent&nbsp;fixture with an LED Linear tube seems like an appealing option. You achieve some of the energy savings associated with LEDs without having to purchase and install a new fixture. The popularity behind LED tubes is their simplicity and low cost. However, LED tubes have many pitfalls, including leaving a considerable amount of energy savings on the table.&nbsp; Lighting retrofits are a major investment and happen infrequently. Understanding all your options will help you make a more informed decision and allow you to maximize your energy savings.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Different Types of LED Tubes</strong></p>
<p>Underwriters Laboratories (UL) certifies three different LED tube options under its UL1598 certification.</p>
<p><em>Type A</em>: These types of tubes operate using an internal driver that is powered directly from an existing linear fluorescent ballast.&nbsp; These tubes are designed to work with T12, T8, and T5. Type A installations do not require any modifications to the existing fixture and many people refer to this type of lamp as ‘plug-and-play.’ Type A tubes have reduced efficiency from power loss through the existing ballast and limited dimming and controllability capabilities.</p>
<p><em>Type B</em>: These types of tubes operate using an internal driver and are powered directly from the main voltage that is supplying the fixture. These tubes require modifying the existing fixture, which has led to referring to this type of lamp as ‘ballast by-pass.’ These lamps require installation by a certified electrician and have limited dimming and controllability capabilities.</p>
<p><em>Type C</em>: These types of tubes operate using a remote driver, which replaces the existing fixtures’ ballast. These types of tubes require modifying the existing fixture, but the power being directed to the sockets is Low-Voltage (LV), not AC Mains. Type C tubes are more efficient than the other types but lack compatibility with Smart Lighting Systems.</p>
<p><strong>The Pitfalls of All LED Tubes</strong></p>
<p>Like any other technology, LED tubes have some pros, but be aware of their cons:</p>
<p><em>Poor Thermal Management:&nbsp;</em>Heat is the kryptonite of the semiconductors that power LED lighting. The heat that the LED diode generates must be dissipated and the shape of a tube does not allow for proper air circulation, and the tubes’ shape provides a limited surface area to remove heat. The rule of thumb in electronic design is for every 10°C rise, the average reliability is decreased by 50%. In addition, there are many manufacturers of LED tubes, making it extremely difficult to evaluate how all the options dissipate heat. If a tube lacks the proper thermal management, it will decrease its life below the tube’s L70 rating.</p>
<p><em>Poor Light Distribution</em>: Fluorescent&nbsp;lamps operate by projecting light in all directions. Fluorescent fixtures are designed with a reflector system to diffuse this omnidirectional light and direct it. LED tubes do not project omnidirectional light, instead projecting light only downwards. If we were to bisect a LED tube, we would find the ‘top-half’ containing the heat sink system and electronics with the ‘bottom-half’ containing the light emitting diodes. By only projecting light downwards, LED tubes do not fully utilize the existing fixtures’ reflector system, which can result in less useable light than a florescent lamp.</p>
<p><em>Limited Capability with Existing Control Systems</em>: If a facility has an existing fluorescent dimming system, staff must be diligent when selecting a tube manufacturer. Compatibility between the existing fluorescent dimming ballast and new LED tube must be ensured. If an incompatible tube is selected, the fixture will no longer dim, lowering potential energy savings. Additionally, light levels can vary per tube when dimmed. So, over a long hallway, the result is uneven light levels that are visually unappealing. Planning for a tube retrofit into an existing fluorescent dimming system requires due diligence before purchase and installation.</p>
<p><strong>LED Tubes and Smart Lighting Systems</strong></p>
<p>Smart Lighting Systems is the concept of tailoring the light levels of individual fixtures to meet specific work requirements. To achieve the greatest amount of energy savings, we combine these individual luminaires into a network. &nbsp;These individual products communicate using a set protocol over a physical layer that is controlled by a central server. Individual devices receive a unique address, which allows for two-way communication between a controller and the device. Networks can be hard wired or wireless, depending on preference. The result is a lighting system that creates an ideal visual environment while saving the maximum amount of energy.</p>
<p>The opportunity to decide on implementing a Smart Lighting System overlaps with a decision for upgrading to LED. LED tubes lack the sophistication to integrate into a digital network without the purchase of additional equipment; however, installing new LED fixtures with digital drivers is a proven solution to maximize energy savings and increase occupant comfort. The LED tube space is changing fast.&nbsp; Some manufacturers are now marketing Zigbee enabled LED tubes that use Bluetooth to communicate to wireless sensors. The safest bet for a facility considering a Smart Lighting Solutions is to speak to a lighting professional about all the options available. In most cases, a new LED fixture will maximize energy savings because fixture replacement does not have to occur on a one-for-one basis.</p>
<p>LED tubes are a viable option if a facility is looking for a simple re-lamp. However, if a facility has an existing fluorescent dimming system and maximizing energy savings is critical to project goals, then LED tubes may not be the most effective option. Because lighting upgrades happen infrequently, it is critical that decision makers consider all options to ensure that project goals are met.</p>

1097,"Making existing lending processes drive energy efficiency",NULL,NULL,"<h2>Making existing lending processes drive energy efficiency</h2>

<p>A recent article entitled “<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://urbangreencouncil.org/content/news/all-lenders-must-be-green-lenders"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">All Lenders must be green lenders</a>” by friend and EnergyPro collaborator in the US Sean Neil emphasised an important aspect of green and energy efficiency financing that often seems to be forgotten and which we have been writing about for a while.&nbsp; This is how do we ensure that all lending is green, or in the specific case of energy efficiency, how do we all ensure all financing achieves the optimum levels of energy efficiency.&nbsp; This text draws upon the&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://valueandrisk.eefig.eu/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">EEFIG Underwriting Toolkit</a>&nbsp;and work I carried out for KAPSARC on financing energy productivity.</p>

<p>Every working day loans, mortgages, leases and investments are made into new buildings, building refurbishments and modernisation as well as upgrade and replacement of industrial processes and production plants.&nbsp;<strong> In nearly all cases, energy efficiency is not the primary purpose of the investment being financed but the future levels of energy efficiency are effectively being decided and “locked in”</strong>, in some cases because of the long life of major assets for many decades.&nbsp; Although new buildings, refurbishments or new production plants generally achieve higher levels of efficiency than the units that they replace due to a) improved technologies and b) tighter regulations and codes of practice, many&nbsp;<em>cost-effective</em>opportunities to improve energy efficiency are missed.&nbsp; This occurs due to a number of reasons including; lack of knowledge on the part of project hosts, time pressure, the conservative nature of engineering design, and treating regulations as a target that have to be achieved rather than a minimum level of performance.&nbsp; Banks and financial institutions can play an active role in ensuring financed projects of all types achieve optimum levels of efficiency over and above business as usual by adjusting the lending/investing process to include queries about energy efficiency and the provision of assistance to identify viable projects.&nbsp; By doing this they can both reduce risks, by financing measures that improve customers’ cash flows, and potentially increase lending.</p>

<p>The EBRD has long been a pioneer in exploiting the opportunities provided by everyday, non-energy efficiency lending activities.&nbsp; As well as specialised efficiency projects the EBRD checks&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>industrial or commercial loan applications to assess potential for energy efficiency improvements.&nbsp; The bank then works with the client organisation to develop the priority projects and these are incorporated into the loan application.&nbsp; This process ensures that all commercially and financially viable improvements are incorporated, improves the client’s cash flow (which reduces the lending risk) and increases the capital deployed.</p>

<p>In commercial real estate funding for the acquisition or refinancing of a building an investor or lender will typically review the building’s financials, rent roll and history and require a Physical Needs Assessment (PNA) or comparable review. It can be a relatively simple matter to make energy efficiency assessments and ratings such as Energy Performance Certificates part of that PNA, and even to make performance standards part of a lender’s requirements.&nbsp; Some banks including ING and ABN Amro have implemented these kinds of programmes and are going further by providing tools to assist owners to identify energy efficiency measures.</p>

<p>ING Real Estate Finance (ING REF) set an ambition of reducing CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions from its Dutch portfolio by 15-20% with a target of energy cost savings of EUR 50 million per year.&nbsp; This entailed targeting 3,000 Dutch clients with 28,000 buildings.&nbsp; ING paid for the development of an app which was offered to all clients – the app provides an analysis of the clients energy use across their portfolio and identifies potential energy savings.&nbsp; If the potential energy savings exceed EUR 15,000 the client is offered a free site energy survey.</p>

<p>ING REF also provides advice to clients on what subsides are available (through a specialist third party) and ING REF offers 100% finance for energy efficiency improvements from ING Groenbank with a 0.5% discount on normal interest rates. &nbsp;Within the first two years, the app was used to scan 18,000 buildings with a total floor area of 10 million m<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>(65% of ING REF’s portfolio).&nbsp; ING aims to roll out the app to other European countries.</p>

<p>The important thing here is that, as Sean says in his article, just by making small adjustments to existing processes for lending and investing, banks and investors could have a significant effect on future levels of energy efficiency, as well as identifying additional opportunities to lend and to reduce risks.&nbsp; Banks and investors need to ensure&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;projects they back, in whatever sector they are, real estate, industry, infrastructure, transport or energy supply, incorporate&nbsp;<em>all cost-effective</em>&nbsp;energy efficiency measures.&nbsp; If they don’t they are aiding and abetting developers and operators to lock in unnecessarily high levels of energy waste for the foreseeable future, sometimes even for decades.</p>

1098,"Four reasons why financial institutions should be active in energy efficiency",NULL,NULL,"<h2>Four reasons why financial institutions should be active in energy efficiency</h2>

<p><em>This is the first in a series of blogs based on and picking up key elements in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://valueandrisk.eefig.eu/"" target=""_blank"">EEFIG Underwriting Toolkit</a>&nbsp;which was published in June. The Toolkit aims to equip financing institutions to better value and assess the risks of energy efficiency projects.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>There are <strong>four reasons</strong> why financial institutions should consider deploying capital into energy efficiency:</p>
<ul> 	<li>energy efficiency represents a <strong>large potential market</strong>. The IEA estimates that in 2015 global investment in energy efficiency was USD 221 billion with approximately USD 32 billion being financed through explicit energy efficiency mechanisms such as Energy Performance Contracts or green bonds.&nbsp; To achieve our climate goals this level of investment needs to grow to circa USD 1 trillion per annum by 2050 and the provision of finance can help overcome some of the barriers to energy efficiency investment.</li> 	<li><strong>reducing risks</strong> in two ways. Firstly, increasing energy efficiency improves the cash flow of clients, thus reducing their risk. Secondly there is the risk of financing assets that become stranded as energy efficiency regulations are tightened. For example, in England &amp; Wales it will become unlawful to lease a commercial building with an Energy Performance Certificate rating below E on 1st&nbsp;April 2018.&nbsp; This puts owners of low performing buildings, and their lenders, at risk.</li> 	<li>improving energy efficiency has a direct <strong>impact on reducing emissions</strong> of carbon dioxide and other environmental impacts such as local air pollution and therefore should be a key part of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programmes. Energy efficiency is regarded as one of the key pathways to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</li> 	<li>bank regulators are increasingly looking at <strong>climate related risks</strong>. Actions include asking banks to disclose the climate-related risks of their loan portfolios.&nbsp; In France disclosing climate-related risks is already required by law.&nbsp; This will allow financial institutions to be better informed about loan performance and thus the cost of risk and carry out better risk appraisal.&nbsp; Possible future actions may include reducing capital reserve requirements for “green” financing.</li> </ul>

<p>Each of these four factors are considered in more detail below.</p>

<p><strong>A large potential market</strong></p>
<p>The IEA estimate that that in 2015 total global investment into demand-side energy efficiency was USD 221 billion, USD 118 billion in buildings, USD 39 billion in industry and USD 64 billion in transport.&nbsp; Investment into energy efficiency was less than 14% of total energy sector investment but increased by 6% in 2015 whereas investment into energy supply fell. The US, EU and China represent nearly 70% of the total investment into efficiency.&nbsp; Total investment into efficiency can be split into “core” investments, where the motivation is specifically to achieve energy savings, and “integrated” investments which are the regular transactions in which energy efficiency is not the motivation but which improve efficiency because the new product is more efficient than the one it replaces.</p>

<p>To date about 85%, of all energy efficiency investment has been financed with existing sources of finance or self-financing rather than specific energy efficiency products or programmes.&nbsp; The global market for Energy Performance Contracts, which are most often associated with external financing, was USD 24 billion in 2015 and of this USD 2.7 billion was in Europe.&nbsp; In addition, about USD 8.2 billion of green bonds were used to finance energy efficiency.</p>

<p>In order to achieve climate targets the level of investment in energy efficiency, and the level of energy efficiency financing, will need to increase substantially.&nbsp; The IEA and IRENA estimate that to achieve their “66% 2°C” scenario cumulative, global investment in energy efficiency between 2016 and 2050 will need to reach USD 39 trillion of which USD 30 trillion would be in the G20 economies, implying a global level of c.USD 1 trillion a year compared to the current level of USD 221 billion – a five-fold increase.</p>

<p>The business opportunity for financial institutions falls into two categories:</p>
<ul> 	<li>creating new business lines for specific energy efficiency projects e.g. specific energy efficiency loans, mortgages or funds.</li> 	<li>ensuring normal lending and investing which is being used to finance projects where energy efficiency is not the primary objective, e.g. building refurbishments or production facility upgrades, is leveraged to ensure funded projects achieve the optimum cost-effective levels of energy efficiency which are usually higher than “business as usual” levels.</li> </ul>
<p>Energy efficiency projects often have rapid paybacks.&nbsp; In EEFIG’s DEEP (Derisking Energy Efficiency Platform) database, which includes over 7,500 projects, the average reported paybacks are 5 years for buildings and 2 years for industrial projects. Despite this economic attractiveness many potential projects do not proceed because of other priorities of the other project host, lack of internal capacity to develop projects, or shortage of investment capital.&nbsp; Furthermore, normal investments in building refurbishments and industrial facilities or new buildings and facilities often do not utilise all of the cost-effective potential for energy efficiency.&nbsp; The provision of third party finance through business models that reduce the overall cost to the host is an important way of overcoming some of the barriers to improving energy efficiency and represents a major business opportunity for financial institutions.</p>

<p><strong>Reducing risk</strong></p>
<p>Energy efficiency investments can reduce risks for financial institutions in two ways:</p>
<ul> 	<li>assisting individual clients, whether they be businesses or individuals, to reduce their energy costs improves their cash flow and profitability, as well as increasing their resilience to energy price rises. Reduced expenditure on energy translates directly to improved cash flow which improves the affordability of loans or mortgages, thus lowering risks to the lender.</li> 	<li>Tightening regulations around energy efficiency, particularly buildings such as Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards, mean that it will become impossible to rent or sell energy inefficient buildings. This is a stranded asset risk for the owner and lender.</li> </ul>
<p>Increasing levels of energy efficiency, essentially reducing the amount of energy used for any activity, is a central part of European policy to address concerns about energy security and climate change. &nbsp;European policy is driving tighter energy efficiency regulations for buildings, equipment and appliances as well as vehicles.&nbsp; The main EU policies are the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) and the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) and in November 2016 the European Commission, in its Winter Package, “<em>Clean Energy for all Europeans</em>”, proposed further tightening of energy efficiency regulations.</p>

<p>Some member states have implemented Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) (also known as Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS)) which mean that after a certain date buildings with an energy efficiency below a set level cannot be sold or rented. These regulations mean that significant proportions of existing real estate portfolios could lose their income and asset value if they are not upgraded to a higher level of energy efficiency.&nbsp; For owners of large property portfolios, or banks lending to property owners, this represents a significant risk which needs to be addressed.</p>

<p><strong>The environmental impacts of energy efficiency</strong></p>
<p>For many years advocates of energy efficiency have argued that it is the lowest cost source of energy services and a low-cost route to achieving significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. This has now been recognised both by policy makers and by many financial institutions.&nbsp; The projects in EEFIG’s DEEP (Derisking Energy Efficiency Platform) database suggest that the median avoided cost of energy is 2.5 Eurocents/kWh for buildings and 1.2 Eurocents/kWh for industry, which is lower than generation costs.&nbsp; Energy efficiency has been described as “the linchpin that can keep the door open to a 2°C future”.&nbsp; The IEA estimates that in achieving a 2°C scenario energy efficiency must account for 38% of the total cumulative emission reduction through 2050, while renewable energy only needs to account for 32%.&nbsp; For financial institutions looking to make a positive impact on resolving environmental problems as part of Corporate Social Responsibility programmes supporting energy efficiency should be a high priority.&nbsp; As well as reducing emissions of carbon dioxide that drive global climate change, reducing energy consumption can also have a positive effect on local air pollution.</p>

<p><strong>Energy efficiency and financial regulators</strong></p>
<p>Financial regulators are taking an increased interest in systemic risks including climate change.&nbsp; There is also a growing interest from regulators and governments in encouraging the growth of “green finance”.&nbsp; The European Systemic Risk Board in its Scientific Advisory Committee report of February 2016, “<em>Too little, too sudden</em>”, warned of the risks of “contagion” and stranded assets if moves to a low carbon economy happened too late or too abruptly.&nbsp; The report’s policy recommendations including increased reporting and disclosure of climate related risks and incorporating climate related prudential risks into stress testing.</p>

<p>In December 2016, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) published its recommendations which included disclosure of organisations’ forward looking climate related risks.</p>

<p>In July 2015, France strengthened mandatory climate disclosure requirements for listed companies and introduced the first mandatory requirements for institutional investors as part of Article 173 of the&nbsp;<em>Law for the Energy Transition and Green Growth</em>.&nbsp; These provisions require listed companies to disclose in the annual report “<em>the financial risks related to the effects of climate change and the measures adopted by the company to reduce them, by implementing a low-carbon strategy in every component of its activities</em>.”&nbsp; Institutional investors will also be required to “<em>mention in their annual report, and make available to their beneficiaries, information on how their investment decision-making process takes social, environmental and governance criteria into consideration, and the means implemented to contribute to the energy and ecological transition.”</em>&nbsp; The law also requires the government to implement stress testing reflecting the risks associated with climate change.</p>

<p>This trend towards greater disclosure and open assessment of climate-related risks is likely to continue across Europe.</p>

<p>These four reasons suggest that energy efficiency should be on the board room agenda of financial institutions.&nbsp; Whatever the markets they operate in there are growth opportunities as well as opportunities to reduce risks.</p>

<p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>The document, while being very thorough and professionally compiled, had left out an important answer to a question the CFO would need answered if he were to move forward with the report’s recommendations.

<p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>The problem with the audit was that it did not result in a viable plan of action. When no action is taken, energy audits are an expense that should not have been incurred.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></p>

He discussed the&nbsp;<strong>Project Financing Assessment</strong>&nbsp;as the most efficient way to begin the decision making process that leads to successful projects.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></p>
<p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>The assessment requires gathering a proprietary list of data points, along with supporting information, that results in the creation of potential financing options the project could be eligible for.

<p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>During the same meeting Ringlein illustrated by example what can happen when the&nbsp;<strong>Project Financing Assessment</strong>&nbsp;is not performed first.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></p>
<p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>He described a case where the client had completed all the necessary steps needed to initiate a proposed project including a detailed audit.

<p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Ringlein noted that for the sake of efficiency, the liens should have been determined before any other work was performed.

<p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>His vision for process efficiency requires that the very first step completed on a project is answering the question about funding options that meet a company’s specific financial guidelines.

1100,"Digital platforms in the energy sector – definition & first applications",NULL,NULL,"
<p>Integrating renewables into the electricity system is a challenging</p>
<p>task. Currently, different concepts of how to do this are being</p>
<p>discussed. In our last two posts we focussed on different concepts for</p>
<p>regional <a href=""https://www.enerquire.com/blog/uzsa870ypystg7nxzv3n8kkld0ljas"" target=""_blank"">flexibility markets in Europe</a> and <a href=""https://www.enerquire.com/blog/regional-flexibility-market-the-german-perspective"" target=""_blank"">Germany</a>. In addition, we raised the question whether the <a href=""https://www.enerquire.com/blog/the-future-of-dsos-digital-platform-provider-vs-asset-ownership"" target=""_blank"">future of the distribution grid operators</a></p>
<p>lies in platform businesses or basic asset ownership. In all our recent</p>
<p>posts the discussion evolved around markets and platforms. Though these</p>
<p>are two important topics, they are not the same. Therefore, in today’s</p>
<p>post we will shed some light on platforms and their potential role in</p>
<p>the energy sector.</p>

<h2>What are platforms?</h2>

<p>The term ‘platform’ is used to describe many different things. As <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314000456"" target=""_blank"">Gawer (2014)</a></p>
<p>pointed out, the term platform is used in a technological (a core</p>
<p>technology in a modular architecture), an organizational (institutions</p>
<p>that facilitate coordination between agents) and in an economical way.</p>
<p>For now, let us focus on the last dimension of platforms. There are</p>
<p>certain criteria that are used to define platforms from an economic</p>
<p>perspective. On a general basis, platforms at least have to fulfil two</p>
<p>criteria (cf. <a href=""http://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/cibs/pdf/RochetTirole3.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Rochet &amp; Tirole 2003</a>):</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;A platform can be defined as an intermediary between different (at least two) users or user groups.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A platform addresses network externalities: This means that the</p>
<p>individual user of a platform gains more from this service (higher</p>
<p>utility), the larger the number of total users of the platform.</p>
<p>Cross-side externalities are in most cases positive, e.g. the higher the</p>
<p>number of stores that accept a certain credit card, the higher the</p>
<p>incentive for a consumer to use this credit card. Same-side</p>
<p>externalities, on the other hand, occur on one side of the market,</p>
<p>either positive or negative, e.g. the higher the number of app</p>
<p>developers for a smart phone operation system, the higher the</p>
<p>competition, which increases price competition.</p>
<p>However, as these criteria are still very general, let’s consult <a href=""http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1334-PDF.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Weiller &amp; Pollitt (2003)</a> for a more precise definition of platforms:</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;A platform is triangular, meaning that the users interact with each other and with the platform provider.</p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A platform facilitates the direct contact between two parties, which</p>
<p>is different from other intermediaries like retailers, who do not</p>
<p>facilitate this direct exchange.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;A platform allows for innovation in complementary services, products, or business models. <a href=""http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1334-PDF.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Weiller &amp; Pollitt (2003)</a></p>
<p>here refer to iTunes to stress the importance of this criterion.</p>
<p>Basically, iTunes provides a technological platform that allows app</p>
<p>developers to add additional innovative services to its system. In most</p>
<p>cases, the current platform business provides a technological innovation</p>
<p>that allows the users on one side of its market to build new innovative</p>
<p>products or services on top of this technological innovation.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Platform</p>
<p>competition is characterised by bundling or enveloping rather than by</p>
<p>the creative destruction process that we know from other sectors in the</p>
<p>Schumpeterian sense: Enveloping or bundling here refers to the fact that</p>
<p>most platform innovations do not create a totally new product, but</p>
<p>rather take an existing platform and use a new technology to bundle this</p>
<p>old product with new features.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Information</p>
<p>and Communication Technology (ICT) provides the basis for platform</p>
<p>businesses. ICT can be considered the General Purpose Technology (GPT)</p>
<p>that provides the technological foundation for platforms. However, GPT</p>
<p>is a much simpler component of the platform that focuses on</p>
<p>technological advancement.</p>
<p>Platforms are often described as</p>
<p>two-sided markets with two distinct user groups on each side (e.g.</p>
<p>drivers and riders in the case of uber). Yet, there are a few</p>
<p>exceptions: <a href=""http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1334-PDF.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Weiller &amp; Politt (2003)</a></p>
<p>observed that not all two-sided markets are platforms, and not all</p>
<p>platforms are two-sided markets. Facebook, for example, started as a</p>
<p>one-sided platform (students at university stay in contact), but is now a</p>
<p>multi-sided market platform (people stay in contact, advertisement,</p>
<p>news etc.).</p>
<p>Summing up, <a href=""http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1334-PDF.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Weiller &amp; Politt (2013)</a> provide the following definition of platforms, which provides a good basis for further discussions:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>A</em></p>
<p><em>platform market is a market where user interactions are mediated by an </em></p>
<p><em>intermediary, the platform provider, and are subject to network effects.</em></p>
<p><em>As opposed to a marketplace or trading exchange, a platform </em></p>
<p><em>intermediary must offer inherent value beyond the simple mediation </em></p>
<p><em>process for the two sides of the market. This added-value usually comes </em></p>
<p><em>from ICT and the associated complementary innovation that increases </em></p>
<p><em>utility and attractiveness of the platform to all user groups. (<a href=""http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1334-PDF.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Weiller &amp; Pollitt 2003:7</a>)</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Demand Response &amp; ancillary services - first platform markets in the energy sector?</h2>

<p>Based</p>
<p>on Weiller &amp; Pollitt’s understanding of platforms, we are wondering</p>
<p>in what direction platform businesses in the energy sector might</p>
<p>evolve. Especially one criterion that is used to define platforms</p>
<p>narrows down the number of potential applications: “<em>added-value from</em></p>
<p><em>platforms usually comes from ICT and the associated complementary </em></p>
<p><em>innovation that increases utility and attractiveness of the platform to </em></p>
<p><em>all user groups“</em>. Where in the energy sector can we expect that complementary innovations evolve based on ICT? As we have discussed in this <a href=""https://www.enerquire.com/blog/digitalization-in-the-energy-sector-german-utilities-at-a-cross-roads"" target=""_blank"">post</a></p>
<p>digitalization in the energy sector starts with the smart meter roll</p>
<p>out. Based on smart metering, data for different platform markets might</p>
<p>become available. For now, let us take a brief look at two related</p>
<p>markets that are currently evolving: Demand response and regional</p>
<p>flexibility provision (ancillary services).</p>

<h3>Platform Markets and ancillary services from distributed resources</h3>

<p>In</p>
<p>recent discussions in the US and Europe, the active involvement of</p>
<p>distributed generators in the ancillary service market is deemed to be</p>
<p>one promising application for platform markets in the energy sector. As</p>
<p>we have introduced in our last two posts on regional flexibility markets</p>
<p>(<a href=""https://www.enerquire.com/blog/uzsa870ypystg7nxzv3n8kkld0ljas"" target=""_blank"">here</a> you can find the European debate and <a href=""https://www.enerquire.com/blog/regional-flexibility-market-the-german-perspective"" target=""_blank"">here</a></p>
<p>the Germany view), platform markets are one approach to actively</p>
<p>involve distributed renewable generators in flexibility markets (e.g.</p>
<p>for ancillary services like voltage control). The primary advantage of</p>
<p>the platform market for ancillary services is the ability to access</p>
<p>different products and address different needs.</p>
<p>Here, the</p>
<p>potential of platforms to allow complementary innovations becomes a key</p>
<p>element: We know that we need distributed generation for ancillary</p>
<p>services in the future, but we expect the platform market to develop</p>
<p>additional products and services that increase the utility of the</p>
<p>distributed generators, aggregators, network operators, balancing</p>
<p>responsible parties and other platform users. Thereby, more distributed</p>
<p>generators should be attracted to join the platform market and</p>
<p>ultimately, the platform could be used to involve the demand side as</p>
<p>well, providing flexibility from generation and demand. &nbsp;This leads us</p>
<p>to a second application of platform markets in the energy sector: Demand</p>
<p>response.</p>

<h3>Platform Markets and Demand Response</h3>

<p>Especially</p>
<p>in the US, demand response (DR) is already in application. Basically,</p>
<p>we can define DR as temporary changes in the electricity usage patterns</p>
<p>of end-consumers resulting from the changes in electricity price or from</p>
<p>other types of incentive payments (<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378779608001272"" target=""_blank"">Albadi &amp; El-Saadany, 2008</a>).</p>
<p>Therefore, demand response aims at shifting energy consumption from one</p>
<p>point in time to another to increase system efficiency, but this does</p>
<p>not require that DR actually reduces the total energy consumption as</p>
<p>such.</p>
<p>For example, in California the three largest Investor Owned</p>
<p>Utilities (IOUs) already contracted 320 MW (in three auctions) of demand</p>
<p>response capacity. Among these demand response providers are Tesla</p>
<p>(with only a small share of the total capacity) and other companies like</p>
<p>OhmConnect (more than 60 MW contracted with the IOUs). OhmConnect</p>
<p>aggregates the flexibility from private households (behaviour-based load</p>
<p>reduction) and sells this flexibility to the IOUs. Similar initiatives</p>
<p>like Nest, who aggregate 50,000 thermostats in California, or OPower</p>
<p>successfully provide demand response services in the US (more info about</p>
<p>the DR initiatives in the US can be found<a href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/californias-dram-tops-200mw-as-utilities-pick-winners-for-distributed-energ"" target=""_blank""> here @Greentechmedia</a>).</p>
<p>All of these different initiatives have in common that they gain from</p>
<p>network effects: The larger the number of involved households, the</p>
<p>larger the individual benefit for each of them. The potential for</p>
<p>platform markets in the context of demand response seems to be huge.</p>

<h2>Platform markets – one part of the energy transition with huge potential</h2>

<p>The</p>
<p>energy transition triggers a decentralization of generation, especially</p>
<p>from renewable resources. Platform markets might help us to increase</p>
<p>coordination and unlock new flexibility potential from generators and</p>
<p>new loads like electric vehicles, battery storage or heat pumps. First</p>
<p>initiatives in the US, especially in New York, aim at the development of</p>
<p>platform markets (see this <a href=""https://www.enerquire.com/blog/the-future-of-dsos-digital-platform-provider-vs-asset-ownership"" target=""_blank"">post</a></p>
<p>for more details). For now, these platforms are only concepts, but we</p>
<p>will see many different developments in this area soon, especially as</p>

1101,"The 4th Utility: Compressed Air",NULL,NULL,"<h2>Compressed Air: the 4th Utility</h2>
<p>Without knowing who has invented this phrase, e.g. <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.nwitimes.com/business/local/compressed-air-called-fourth-utility/article_2dbfb309-224c-5e24-91aa-ea4b0f3556a9.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">David Andrews from Sullair</a> used it in a recent blog and it is even mentioned at wikipedia, it clearly indicates the relevance it has in terms of energy consumption. In <strong>Europe there are more than 300.000 compressed air systems </strong>installed. More than 60.000 in Germany alone consuming more electricity than produced by a nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>And according to the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/publications/efficiency/industrial/cipec/5637"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Natural Resouces Canada</a>, <strong>out of 100 units of energy less than 10 units are turned into useful compressed air. </strong></p>
<p>As a technology consuming a lot of energy or in other words causing high costs, investing time into optimising compressed air systems or even upgrading/replacing old ones, seems to be a meaningful activity. So does that lead to a triple-win scenario?, a scenario where suppliers win (more sales of energy efficient compressed air systems), where users win (lower energy consumption = lower operational costs), where the environment wins (less energy consumed)?</p>
<h3>The double-win scenario</h3>
<p>There are clearly a number of conventional actions possible to save energy and costs. This would mainly benefit the users and the environment as this activties would be mostly done in-house. NRC classifies them in three areas:</p>
<p><strong>1. Housekeeping</strong><br /> This is mainly about the pure basics, ranging from ""know you loads and check them regularly"" to ""check the system (joints, valves, fittings, hose connections, air filters) and use only lowest possible pressure for each job</p>
<p><strong>2. Low-cost opportunities</strong><br /> This could be considered as compressed air system management. It covers activties such as meter use, cost calculations per user or installation of sequence controllers. But it also goes further to investigate and implement system improvements, e.g. ""discharge air-cooled compressors outside in summer and inside in winter"" up to ""investigate recapturing heat ..""</p>
<p><strong>3. Retrofits</strong><br /> NRC descibes here activities such as the integration of independant compressed air generating and distribution circuits, intelligent control systems up to finally replacing compressors.</p>
<p>Eventhough this approaches are looking quite convincing, considering what is most relevant for users when thinking about compressed air - it might not be energy efficiency.</p>
<p>The criteria ranking usually looks the following</p>
<ol> 	<li><strong>Reliabilty</strong>: Compressed air is essential for the production process and any breakdown equates to lost of production</li> 	<li><strong>Quality</strong>: In some processes, compressed air comes direct in contact with finished products, e.g. in food processing, pharaceuticals or electronics). Therefore, poor air quality leads to reducted product quality</li> 	<li><strong>Costs</strong>: Energy costs represent 50% of TCO for a compressor - but for various reasons, costs seem to be the least important criteria. Sometimes a ""lack of awareness of possible savings"" is mentioned. Well, that might not be true for the engineer but for the management level. It can also be linked to the absence of compressed air cost accounting making it difficult to push any investment proposal through internal investment committees.</li> </ol>
<h3>The triple win-scenario</h3>





<p>In a triple-win scenario, a supplier needs to convince a user (in other words ""sell"") their compressed air solutions. As they also have to deal with this criteria ranking, reliability - quality - costs, it might be worth a look how sales propositions of compressed air suppliers look like.</p>
<p>As we are intending to make this post the start of a new series about ""most promising sales propositions to overcome decision making process inertia"" (yes, very long title - we work on that), we will start with some companies we spoke to at the 2017 Hannover Messe. We are aiming to find good practice examples finally helping to implement more energy efficient compressed air solutions.</p>
<p>One company I spoke with was Almig. Interestingly, Almig shows a strong focus on the ""energy cost saving"" side picking up the two likely most relevant opportunities to save energy:</p>
<ul> 	<li><strong>System optimization</strong>: Their so called EBS system (Energy Balancing System) is a 3-step service including measurement, analysis and simulation</li> 	<li><strong>Heat Recovery</strong>: As most of the energy to produce compressed air is effectively producing heat, they offer solutions to re-use the heat for warm water and space heating purposes</li> </ul>
<p>When it comes to heat, another interesting solution provider we met is company AltAIRnative (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/articles/detailed/2d9e8c5c1f3ce26759b6e90b61109fd8/compressed-air-hannover-messe-2017-follow-up/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">see recent post</a>) who turned the ""heat topic"" upward-down - as they produce heat and compressed air is the by-product!</p>
<p>When talking about sales propositions, the most often heard buzz word is surely IoT or industry4.0. Almig seems to avoid this phrase (as this sounds still scary to many engineers/buyers?). They talk about ""Telemonitoring"" which effectively lists the advantages of (again in buzz words) ""IoT use case predictive maintenance"". It is probably worth a debate to what extend it is meaningful today to exploit the industry4.0/telemonitoring opportunities. It clearly adresses criteria number one, the reliability, but could also be used e.g. to overcome accounting barriers. For example, linking electricity prices to produced compressed air in real-time or offer new services such as&nbsp; ""pay by produced compressed air"" with no fixed assets for the client leading to better ROCE, a financial indicator often used in stock market listed companies. And there are likely many more opportunities.</p>

1102,"Strategic: Investing in industrial Energy Efficiency is a major decision",NULL,NULL,"<h2>Investing in industrial energy efficiency is a major decision &nbsp;</h2>
<p>To succeed, businesses are continually investing in product inputs, equipment, buildings, marketing, distribution and people to name but a few. Most of the expenditure is essential to simply stay in business. Industrial companies are a complex of literally hundreds and thousands of elements.</p>
<p>Investing in the enterprise is essential to maintain one’s competitive position. Understandably no one wants to invest in measures that have no value to the company and that do not contribute to the bottom line. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All recent studies show that there is considerable potential for investing in cost-effective energy efficiency measures.&nbsp; Somehow, they do not get the attention by senior management or in the boardroom that they deserve. As Dr Catherine Cooremans from the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland writes in a paper for the 2017 eceee summer study [<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.eceee.org/summerstudy/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">http://www.eceee.org/summerstudy/</a>]: “investment decisions are the product of a complex process influenced by many different factors, which can be classified into four broad categories:</p>
<ol> 	<li>external context, which refers to a firm’s environment,</li> 	<li>internal context, which comprises structure and management systems, strategy and organizational culture, and revenues/cost relations,</li> 	<li>actors involved, either individuals or groups, which can be more or less powerful, and</li> 	<li>characteristics of the investment to be made.”&nbsp;</li> </ol>

<p>Dr. Cooremans uses the following diagram: &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""320"" height=""110"" src=""fileadmin/_processed_/d/6/csm_fc8446cdd0_dab8e82d0d.png"" width=""546"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>



<h3>Strategicity &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Dr. Cooremans goes on: “In this framework, investment characteristics strongly influence decision-making. Investment characteristics are numerous and diverse. Among these characteristics, an investment’s strategic character – i.e. its “strategicity” – plays a paramount role in decision-making. Strategicity, which can be defined as an investment’s contribution to a firm’s competitive advantage, is more important than profitability in the competition for resources, which exists in any organization.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Cooremans makes an important point about the strategic aspect of investments.&nbsp; She further states that: “Many factors, internal as well external to the firm, influence an energy-efficiency investment decision.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Taking a close look at your own company &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The important point Dr. Cooremans makes is that energy efficiency investments should be considered strategically.&nbsp; Too often senior management essentially snubs at such investments. Yet, too often, senior management does not know or does not appreciate the full range of benefits from energy efficiency investments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you know how energy efficient your operations are?&nbsp; Have you invested to make improvements? Did you have to borrow to finance such measures? Did you set aside such measures because they were too expensive or too complicated?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that too often paying for the energy used in your operations is just considered ‘business as usual’, without much thought that those expenditures could be reduced to a point that you would see it on your bottom line. &nbsp;This attitude – for whatever reason – means reducing energy consumption isn’t yet considered of strategic importance to your management decisions – yet! &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Where ICP can help &nbsp;</h3>
<p>As Dr. Cooremans states, there are many factors that influence decisions and action. The <strong>Investor Confidence Project</strong> is there to remove many of the complications and risks in improving your company’s energy performance. It ensures that the process of choosing what to do, how to do it and how to finance it is standardised, giving you assurance. It can help senior management better understand energy efficiency from a strategic perspective because it does remove risk. &nbsp;</p>
<p>ICP brought to Europe to develop a system to give confidence to all active stakeholders. There are still concerns that investing in energy efficiency is risky. ICP is designed to change that. ICP started with investments in buildings and is now broadening the scope to include industry, district energy and street lighting through a two-year project funded by the European Commission. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of ICP is relatively simple to understand. A potential project in a factory or a district heating system, for example, is identified. Someone has to do the necessary calculations to determine the viability. Someone has to be identified to install it (often the same organisation). And some organisation needs to fund it. What this project does is standardise the procedures so that all players gain confidence in the system. The factory owner is happy. The developer/auditor/installer is happy. The financial institution is happy. There are protocols in place and third party monitoring to ensure everything is done correctly. The protocols are developed by interested experts and not by commercial interests. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The project will work with all of those involved in the project cycle from owners through to project developers and verifiers. They all have a key role to play.&nbsp; To ensure that the protocols are robust, technical forums are being set up to review the draft protocols and provide important technical input to their development. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For owners or managers</strong>, the ICP approach will provide transparency of the process and will give them the confidence in implementing the measures. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For the project developer</strong>, ICP provides a process that is understood and accepted by all participants. This will reduce transaction costs and should minimise any misunderstandings. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For the financial community</strong>, the ICP approach will standardise the project development process and bring the necessary confidence to undertake the investments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the industry protocol is complete in the next few months, we will be looking for projects to test the system. It has been used successfully for the buildings sector, but we believe there is even more scope for industry. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Sound familiar? &nbsp;</h3>
<p>When was the last time you walked on a factory floor or read an audit report or talked to a plant’s energy manager? Did you notice that some things were left unsaid? Did you notice that the elephant in the room hampered the company’s competitiveness? Did you know there was even an elephant lurking in the background? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m sure you’re confused?&nbsp; Well, we’re all confused to a greater or lesser extent. It is baffling that there is so much cost-effective potential to reduce our energy consumption and yet it is not happening, certainly not to the extent that will significantly improve the company’s competitive position. This concern is not new. Policymakers and many others have struggled for many years – even decades – to understand this phenomenon of inaction.&nbsp; Market barriers have been analysed, policy instruments have been evaluated, business leaders have been questioned. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2015 final report from the Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group states:&nbsp; “Energy efficiency has clearly contributed positively to EU industrial competitiveness, enabling companies to proactively manage energy price increases in Member States and retain export shares, yet experts believe that many of the completed measures are just the ‘low hanging fruits’ (with relatively short payback times) assessed on narrow measures of economic pay-back without considering the wider benefits of energy efficiency investments: The untapped energy efficiency potential remains great.”</p>
<h3>What are the gaps?</h3>
<p>We know about the potential and we know about the impact we want – for individual companies and for our economies as a whole. There is that gap that needs to be filled. That gap does not need to be illusive.&nbsp; There are ways to address it. That gap includes several concerns: financing, confidence in the technologies, confidence in the entire transaction phase including the relationship between the client, the developer and the source of financing. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Financing and Implementation &nbsp;</h3>
<p>There are two aspects of this that I would like to focus on with respect to this process that the Investor Confidence Project Europe, a project funded by the European Commission, is addressing. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>What is ICP Europe and what can it do to encourage more investments? &nbsp; </em></p>
<p>The Investor Confidence Project Europe is designed to remove many of the complications and risks in improving your company’s energy performance. It ensures that the process of choosing what to do, how to do it and how to finance it is standardised, giving you assurance. It can help senior management better understand energy efficiency from a strategic perspective because it does remove risk. &nbsp;</p>
<p>ICP brought to Europe to develop a system to give confidence to all active stakeholders. There are still concerns that investing in energy efficiency is risky. ICP is designed to chang.e that. ICP started with investments in buildings and is now broadening the scope to include industry, district energy and street lighting through a two-year project funded by the European Commission. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of ICP is relatively simple to understand. A potential project in a factory or a district heating system, for example, is identified. Someone has to do the necessary calculations to determine the viability. Someone has to be identified to install it (often the same organisation). And some organisation needs to fund it. What this project does is standardise the procedures so that all players gain confidence in the system. The factory owner is happy. The developer/auditor/installer is happy. The financial institution is happy. There are protocols in place and third party monitoring to ensure everything is done correctly. The protocols are developed by interested experts and not by commercial interests. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The project will work with all of those involved in the project cycle from owners through to project developers and verifiers. They all have a key role to play.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h3>How does it work? &nbsp;</h3>

<p><em>Ensuring the confidence in the process through a certified protocol &nbsp; </em></p>
<p>Key to success, however, is in ensuring there is technical integrity throughout the entire process. To ensure that the protocols are robust, technical forums are being set up to review the draft protocols and provide important technical input to their development. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The existing ICP protocols cover three types of energy efficiency project (Large, Standard, Targeted) in buildings. There is a need for a similar standardized, best practice approach for industrial energy efficiency projects. We are using the structure of the buildings protocols (below) as a basis for developing the industrial protocols, ensuring that we retain a familiar and comprehensive process and vocabulary while making adaptations for more complex industrial environments. &nbsp;</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""322"" height=""85"" src=""fileadmin/_processed_/5/2/csm_ec07b00303_e376a7a986.png"" width=""95"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>





<p>The plan is to include within the</p>
<p>scope of the protocol all Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) associated with</p>
<p>building services or utility energy use. For process energy use, we propose to</p>
<p>include only ‘common’, non-specialist ancillary ECMs, which do not require</p>
<p>industry specific knowledge to develop or implement. For example, motors within</p>
<p>process equipment would be within scope but ovens, kilns, furnaces or</p>
<p>endo/exothermic reactions are not. This is indicated in the following diagram.</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""323"" height=""291"" src=""fileadmin/_processed_/1/1/csm_b5db2ab771_0696bdecd1.png"" width=""926"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>







<p>There is a technical forum, which includes experts from throughout Europe, who are currently reviewing the details of the elements of the protocols. It is essential that the protocols are as robust and credible as possible. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>What we need from you: join Technical Forum &nbsp;</h3>
<p><em>It’s not too late to join Technical Forum </em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To develop such protocols, we are obviously relying on the input from energy efficiency experts such as the energy efficiency networks. Therefore, we would like to invite you to join our Technical Forum to review and comment on the development. &nbsp;</p>
<p>First drafts will be sent around in September 2017 – so there is still time to join. &nbsp;</p>

1104,"Choosing the best techniques for waste heat recovery",NULL,NULL,"<h2>Choosing the best techniques for waste heat recovery</h2>
<p>Darren Bryant, CEO of Heatcatcher UK, discusses best available waste heat recovery techniques for the glass industry and outlines UK government initiatives to help manufacturers with funding.</p>
<p>Heatcatcher started designing, building and operating Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) systems in the lime and cement industry, commissioning its first plant using Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology in 2013 by recovering the exhaust gases from a rotary kiln to generate 0.5MW of electricity for the UK Lhoist site near Durham.</p>
<p>The opportunities and challenges of integrating the best available waste heat recovery techniques into the float and container glass furnaces are similar to the lime and cement industry, except the return on investments are improved because the annual operating hours of the glass furnaces are higher.</p>
<p>All energy intensive industry sectors face increased energy prices and the Heatcatcher team of engineers have applied their knowledge and experience to match the best available ORC and steam expander technologies to recover the heat energy from glass furnace exhausts.</p>
<p>With increased environmental legislation to limit exhaust gas emissions, plants anticipate higher capital costs of additional flue gas treatment (FGT) equipment.</p>
<p>These are often required to operate with lower exhaust gas temperatures and so additional cooling is required. The cost of new FGT equipment and cooling equipment to lower the temperature can be mitigated by a WHR system, removing the heat and converting to low carbon electricity prior to the FGT equipment.</p>
<h3>WHR integration</h3>
<p>Selecting the Best Available Techniques (BAT) for heat exchanger integration and matching it to the best commercially available ORC or Steam Expander is an area of expertise crucial to meeting the technical and economic conditions of a WHR integration project.</p>
<p>Technical considerations include:</p>
<ul> 	<li>How variable is the temperature and mass flow rate of the exhaust gas?</li> 	<li>What is the exhaust gas chemical composition limiting the minimum operating temperature?</li> 	<li>Plant space constraints determining heat exchanger location and ductwork integration.</li> 	<li>Ductwork changes if combining exhaust streams of more than one furnace.</li> 	<li>Heat exchanger cleaning method and pressure system pressure drop.</li> 	<li>Additional WHR system pressure drop effect on process and induced draft fan.</li> 	<li>Variation in exhaust stack efflux velocity from lowering the temperature.</li> 	<li>Future demands on reduced emissions limits and flue gas treatment.</li> </ul>
<h3>WHR economic value</h3>
<p>Once the technical aspects of integration are assessed then the economic considerations of how to gain the greatest value for the typical 15 to 20 year life of a WHR system.</p>
<p>Is the value in producing large quantities of hot water, with a small amount for site usage and the rest to be sold over the fence to a neighbouring plant or a district heating system?</p>
<p>Finding a neighbouring host to consume large quantities of hot water is commercially challenging and the connection to aplanned District Heating Network may receive local government incentives but can be a lengthy process.</p>
<p>Converting the recovered heat to all low carbon electricity or a combination of electricity and a small amount of heat for site usage has been the preferred choice of glass plants that operate WHR systems.</p>
<p>WHR systems in operation include the 1.3MWe ORC generator installed in 2013 at the AGC flat glass plant in Cuneo, Italy; the 0.5MWe ORC generator at the&nbsp; O-I Glass container plant in Villotta di Chions, Italy; the Guardian Glass steam cycle generator being installed at the Goole float glass plant in the UK; the 5.5MWe ORC generator at the Sisecam plant in Bulgaria; and the 0.4MWe steam screw expander installed at the Vetrobalsalamo plant in Milan, Italy.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>With an increased need to mitigate against rising energy costs of glass manufacturing and stakeholder pressure to decarbonise the sector there is a growing interest in WHR solutions.</p>
<p>For example, in November the British Glass Manufacturing Confederation hosted a Knowledge Transfer workshop on WHR that was attended by many company senior representatives, keen to understand about WHR systems.</p>
<p>While many of the technical integration aspects must be satisfied with a feasibility study before a business case can be presented to the board, an investment grade document is needed for the board to decide if the project is to be directly funded from their capital expenditure budget or externally funded under a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) or Energy Services Contract (ESCo).</p>
<p>The UK government has recognised through its ‘Industrial Decarbonisation and Energy Efficiency Roadmap to 2050’ that the cost for Energy Intensive Industries to prepare the feasibility study are substantial.</p>
<p>The department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy is expected to launch the first phase of the ‘Industrial Heat Support Programme’ later this year, offering up to 40% funding support for these feasibility studies.</p>
<p>The second phase of the IHSP in 2018 could fund up to 30% of the capital costs of implementing the best projects identified from the feasibility studies.&nbsp;</p>

1105,"IEA, EU and China advance Energy Efficiency",NULL,NULL,"<p>29 June 2017: According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), energy efficiency is the one energy resource that every country possesses in abundance and is the quickest and least costly way of addressing energy security, environmental and economic challenges. Recent initiatives by the IEA, the EU, Morocco and China have sought to give a boost to energy efficiency.</p>

<p>Latest news on a high-level conference organized by the IEA, the EU’s progress in updating directives and regulations on energy efficiency, and China’s long-term ‘Strategy of Energy Production and Consumption Revolution (2016-2030)’ underline the importance of energy efficiency at the nexus between Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 13 (climate action).</p>
<p><strong>Building High-level Momentum</strong></p>
<p>The second IEA Global Conference on Energy Efficiency, held on 29 June, 2017 in Paris, France, served as a forum for government officials and energy-industry executives to exchange views on, and strengthen engagement in, action to improve energy efficiency. Participants discussed global perspectives, evolution of technology and policy, and financing and investment regarding energy efficiency.</p>
<blockquote><p>The IEA is building a Global Exchange Hub for Energy Efficiency as a resource for policy makers to learn about the nature, success and lessons learned regarding sector-specific policies around the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Noting that only 30% of global energy use is subject to energy efficiency standards, IEA Executive Secretary Fatih Birol underlined the opportunity for improvement. He announced that the IEA is building a Global Exchange Hub for Energy Efficiency as a resource for policy makers to learn about the nature, success and lessons learned regarding sector-specific policies around the world. In a commentary published ahead of the Conference, Birol outlined other measures taken by the IEA, including IEA’s hosting of the Clean Energy Ministerial Secretariat. He also mentioned the IEA association initiative, which aims to open IEA to emerging economies to expand IEA membership to a larger share of global energy use. Current members include China, India, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand.</p>
<p>In his opening address, UN General Assembly President (UNGA) Peter Thomson, welcomed the Conference as an opportunity to step up ambition for implementing SDG 7. He called on countries to: set ambitious national energy efficiency targets; establish policy and regulatory frameworks and integrated energy plans across industries; build strategic and innovative partnerships to drive SDG action; mobilize an estimated US$770 million per year to implement SDG 7, including through the development of new business opportunities and financing models; drive innovation and harness the disruptive potential of new technologies; and promote successful initiatives globally.</p>
<p>Other high-level speakers stressed: the need for governments to work with the private sector in developing energy efficiency standards; using energy efficiency policies to diversify fuel supplies and reducing dependence on foreign energy imports; and promoting energy efficiency as an enabler of economic activity.

<p>In related news, the IEA announced the signing of a three-year joint work programme with Morocco under the IEA’s association initiative. The programme sets out measures for enhancing bilateral cooperation in areas such as energy security, energy efficiency, renewable energy, capacity building and data and statistics. [<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2017/june/morocco-and-iea-sign-three-year-work-programme.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">IEA Press Release 28 June</a>]</p>
<p><strong>Updating EU Legislation</strong></p>
<p>EU Council adopted a new regulation on energy efficiency labeling and agreed its position on proposals for revised directives on energy efficiency and energy performance of buildings.</p>
<p>The new regulation on energy efficiency labeling clarifies, strengthens and extends the scope of the existing regulation. Among other elements, the new regulation re-scales energy efficiency labels based on technological development aiming to avoid the excessive use of higher efficiency classes (A+, A++, A+++). It also: provides incentives for innovation and the phase out less efficient products; sets deadlines for replacing existing energy efficiency labels; sets up a product database to monitor enforcement; and defines delegated acts as main instrument for the re-scaling procedure.</p>
<p>The Council supported the EU Commission’s proposal for a revised energy efficiency directive that aims to improve existing legislation with a view to achieving the EU’s 2020 headline targets and 2030 climate and energy goals. The proposed directive: sets an overall EU energy efficiency target of 30%; defines an energy savings obligation of 1.5% per year, which will decrease to 1% per year after 2026 if the EU is on track towards meeting its targets; and lays out options, rules and restrictions for actions that may be taken by member countries and for the accounting of energy efficiency outcomes.</p>
<p>The Council also supported the Commission’s proposal for a revised directive the energy performance of buildings, which will update minimum standards towards on energy consumption of the EU’s existing building stock. The proposal includes a requirement for member States to establish long-term renovation strategies, address energy poverty and strengthen the links between energy efficiency policy and financing. It also introduces requirements for electric vehicle charging infrastructure such as pre-cabling and minimum numbers of charging points in commercial and non-commercial buildings.

<p><strong>A Strategy for an Energy Efficiency Revolution</strong></p>
<p>The International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation (IPEEC) published an outline of China’s long-term ‘Strategy of Energy Production and Consumption Revolution (2016-2030),’ which was released in December 2016 to support China’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement on climate change. The Strategy delineates policies and measures in the following areas: reform of the demand side; reform of the supply side; reform of the energy market; innovation of energy technology; and strengthened international energy cooperation and improve domestic energy security. The document also sets up binding targets to complement China’s commitment to peak carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions before 2030, including: a 15% minimum energy efficiency improvement during the 13th Five Year Plan period (2016-2020); a cap on total energy consumption of five billion tons of coal equivalent (TCE) for 2016-2020 and less than six billion TCE for 2020-2030; and a minimum requirement for energy from renewable sources to account for 20% by 2030 and over 50% by 2050.

1107,"ICP: Top 2 benefits for energy efficiency project developers",NULL,NULL,"<p>ICP (Investor Confidence Project Europe) delivers a standardised framework for developing energy efficiency projects to reduce uncertainty for clients and investors – to help grow the number of projects and the energy efficiency finance market.</p>
<p>Frameworks already exists for buildings and are now being developed for projects in industry, district energy and street lighting.</p>
<p>The first new framework will be on industry (launch December 2017). <strong>And we are already looking for project developers to apply this framework in pilot projects.</strong></p>
<p>As a project developer, you will ask the question “what´s in it for me” and here is the answer:</p>
<h3>Top 2 benefits why project developers should apply the ICP framework</h3>
<p><strong>No1: Get more clients </strong><br /> A key barrier for industrial clients to start a new energy efficiency project lies in the uncertainty about the outcome, the difference between the “promises” and the “real savings” generated.<br /> This is where the ICP framework comes into play. It is a technology neutral and certifiable process description ensuring that best practices are applied throughout the development of the project. The framework has been developed together with the financial community to help lenders and investors have greater confidence in project outcomes, which basically means an ICP project is more likely to deliver against its promises.<br /> Increased confidence obviously works both ways, it benefits your clients as they can trust that they get what is promised. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For a project developer, <strong>applying the ICP framework becomes a sales argument</strong>: “We will deliver against our promise. You can trust us as we are applying the ICP framework which has been developed by the industry and financial institutions.” &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>No2: Free marketing support </strong><br /> The ICP project in Europe is co-financed by the European Commission (<strong>again, think about trust!</strong>) and EEIP, the largest global industry network for energy efficiency is a partner. Part of EEIP´s contribution is to promote those project developers applying the ICP framework.<br /> As well as the entire energy intensive industry in Europe, EEIP covers the industrial value chain from end to end, which means EEIP is reaching out to all your current and potential clients. &nbsp;</p>
<p>EEIP will tell them that you are a professional project developer using highest standards to deliver against your promises.<br /> And EEIP will also recommend any potential client to “request” project developers to apply the ICP standards. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Reason To Believe &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The underlying objective of the Investor Confidence Project Europe is to help unlock access to financing for the building, industry, district energy and street lighting markets by standardising how energy efficiency projects are developed, documented and measured. Standardization using best practices set out by ICP reduces the risk for investors in regard to the projected outcome of an energy efficiency project. It also reduces time and skills needed by investors to perform due diligence for each individual project. Finally, it reduces transaction costs. These factors open the door for more capital to finance such projects or re-finance investments of project developers and ESCOs.</p>
<p><strong>A side benefit of such a standard is logically that it increases also the certainty for clients of energy efficiency projects that projected energy savings will be delivered.</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<h3>The origin &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The logic behind the ICP approach links back to the outcome of an initiative called Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG), established in 2013 by the European Commission Directorate-General for Energy (DG Energy) and United Nations Environment Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). EEFIG created an open dialogue and work platform for public and private financial institutions, industry representatives and sector experts to identify the barriers to the long-term financing for energy efficiency and proposed policy and market solutions to them. EEFIG has engaged 120 active participants from 100 organizations to deliver clear and unambiguous messages. EEFIG recommended adopting the ICP to Europe and it was introduced in 2015 with the support of Horizon 2020 funding.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h3>The ICP structure</h3>
<p>ICP uses an approach originally developed in the US for the buildings sector. In Europe, it was first adopted for buildings through a project financed by the EC. Now ICP is tackling industry, dristrict energy and street lighting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ICP is based on two foundations:</p>
<ol> 	<li><strong>The ICP framework </strong><br /> 	The ICP framework assembles best practices and existing technical standards into a set of Protocols that define a clear roadmap for developing projects, determining savings estimates, and documenting and verifying results.</li> 	<li><strong>Independant 3rd party certification </strong><br /> 	ICP's Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ (IREE™) is an international certification that insures best practices, the right professionals and third-party validation are used to deliver high-quality projects that you can bank on.&nbsp;</li> </ol>
<h3>What´s happening right now – and how project developers can engage&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Right now, ICP Protocols are being developed for industry and they should be available by the end of the 2017. The protocols for district energy and street lighting will be available early 2018. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How the development of protocols is organised – and how you can participate</strong><br /> Engaging in the development of protocols (the ICP framework) is easy and allows project developers to shape the final product across Europe. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The ICP technical team together with internationally recognised experts are developing a draft which will then be shared with the Technical Forum which acts as the leading technical advisory group to input, discuss and feedback. This process is organised in an iterative way. The Technical Forum is open to all interested experts and the whole process is open source. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Technical Forum</strong><br /> As a Technical Forum member (register here: <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/technical-forum.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">http://europe.eeperformance.org/technical-forum.html </a>) you</p>
<ul> 	<li>receive a draft of the latest protocol in development</li> 	<li>are invited to comment anytime</li> 	<li>are invited to join the Technical Forum webinar where drafts are shared and discussed</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Current time plan for Technical Forum and resource requirements </strong><br /> We are currently in the 2nd of three rounds. Next milestones are</p>
<ul> 	<li>25th October: webinar 2nd draft</li> 	<li>29th November: webinar 3rd and final draft &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p>Prior to each webinar discussion round, technical Forum Members receive the latest status of the protocol for their own preparation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Estimated time investment is 2-3h per round including the webinar. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Which means with a few hours of time investment, you will not only amongst the first in the market to know everything about the new “market standards” but also be able to actively shape them!</p>
<p><strong>Training and support </strong><br /> To apply the protocol to your own energy efficiency projects with your clients, you obviously need to familiarize yourself with the protocol and how it is applied.<br /> To do so, ICP offers s 2-step support for pilot projects (pilot projects are all projects at least starting before May 2019). This <strong>support is free to project developers and owners</strong> as it is funded by Horizon 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step1: An open training webinar for all<br /> Step2: A 1:1 training session with project developer / the project developer team followed by specific technical asssistance as required to get the pilot project certified.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Summary and call to action &nbsp;</h3>

<p>Applying the ICP framework for energy efficiency projects gives you a competitive advantage in the market, more business, better re-financing opportunities and – as part of the ICP EU co-funded project – free marketing support in all European countries and free technical assistance to adopt the ICP system.</p>
<p>We very much appreciate your engagement.<br /> Just <strong>register for the Technical Forum</strong> <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/technical-forum.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">http://europe.eeperformance.org/technical-forum.html</a> and we are looking forward working together and support your business. &nbsp;</p>

1108,"5 steps for a robust energy strategy",NULL,NULL,"<p>According to the recently published article in the Harvard Business Review ""Energy Strategy for the C-suite"", energy is climbing up the corporate agenda. This is true and based on</p>
<ul> 	<li>climate change and global carbon regulation,</li> 	<li>increasing pressures on natural resources,</li> 	<li>rising expectations about corporate environmental performance,</li> 	<li>innovations in energy technologies and business models, and</li> 	<li>plummeting renewable energy prices</li> </ul>
<p>All are representing <strong>megatrends leading to a changing business environment with new risks and new paths to value creation.</strong></p>
<p>According to Andrew Winston, George Favaloro and Tim Healy, many companies have already developed some kind of energy strategies. But they are missing the integration with the overall strategy and do not explicitly adress the strategic implications of the global megatrends. To do so, they recommend 5 steps to build a robust energy strategy.</p>
<h3>1. Start with the C-Level Mandate</h3>
<p>Although not new, this is a MUST to begin with: CEO committment and a clear governance structure is the foundation of any successfull implementation.</p>
<p>It means that the CEO should appoint a senior executive to serve as a champion. Depending on the industry that could be the COO or CFO. First task of this senior executive is to assemble a crosss-functional team from operations, facilities, finance, legal, procurement and sustainability.</p>
<h3>2. Integrate Energy into the Company´s Vision and Operations</h3>
<p>The team need to start with assessing the firm´s internal and external energy impacts. There are various questions to be answered such as ""How much energy does our firm use, and what does it cost? What impact does it have on key financial indicators like costs of goods sold? Do we capitalize on opportunities to use renewables? How does this algn with customer, investor and employee expectations, and how do we compare with competitors?""</p>
<p>Answers will quickly reveal performance opportunities and gaps and allow to develop an action plan.</p>
<p>A key task is then to create the right incentive schemes throuhgout the entire organization. This needs to be supported by advise on how to integrate energy considerations with other strategic processes and priorities. An example is the risk assessment. Facility and and operations managers should consider energy in their resilience and business continuity planning.</p>
<p>Another key area is the alignment of procurement with energy users. Previous energy contracts with certain on-off peak pricing structures might look different when considering new storage or demand-response solutions in the energy use processes. Especially when integrating on-side renewables.</p>
<h3>3. Track Energy at All Levels</h3>
<p>According to the authors, it is often surprising for C-suite executives that companies can not easily say how much energy they consume on corporate and individual operational levels. Energy is amongst people, product costs, facilities and equipment the only one that is most often not monitored and managed carefully.</p>
<p>And monitoring and analyzing energy use can reveal also operating issues affecting costs, performance ans quality.</p>
<p>Companies should also look down into their supply chain. Especially tier1 supplier can have a major indirect impact on costs or achievement of carbon targets as the are also exposed to price volatility and respponsible for a significant level of carbon for the final product or services.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>4. Shift to Renewables and Other Advanced Technologies</h3>
<p>The market for clean energy technology is changing fast and companies need to understand technologies as well as financing options and the business models behind. That covers renewables but also e.g. storage, meters and LED.</p>
<p>For example, in 2015, the average price of electricity from new long-term contract wind power projects in US was <strong>two cents per kilowatt-hour</strong>!</p>
<p>Many corporations are already experimenting witth capturing waste heat for heating and cooling, burning methan from landfills, fuel cells and many more.</p>
<p>Understanding the financing behind the new opportunities is also an area many companies have little knowledge at the moment. Whereas hedging often comes first, the new financial market developments towards green bonds aand ratings can even impact the companies overall costs and/or ability to acess capital markets.</p>
<p>And there are further benefits ranging from reducing policy risks when it comes to carbon pricing, brand benefits and opportuinities for competitive differentiation.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Engage Key Stakeholders</strong></h3>
<p>Companies need also to have a coherent strategy to engage with stakeholders beyond the operational aspects like increasing efficiency or diversifying energy sources.</p>
<p>With clean energy markets rapidly evolving, there is no need anymore to buy from local regulated utility. Dynamic pricing, new financing mechanism, smart grid, battery storage or on-site power generation are new opportunities but are in an early stage with new policy and regulation under development. Engaging with stakeholders to advocate for policies that encourages transformation to the new energy systems need to be on the agenda.</p>
<p>And they neeed to engage with customers, communities, investors and employees as the new solutions will lead companies becoming an integral part of the future energy system - miles away fro&nbsp; the old energy purchase contract of the past.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>The biggest hurdle for many remains the perception that energy is just a cost to be managed. And for smaller companies that this is only something for the big ones.</p>
<p>But this is a misperception. According to the authors, the five steps can be done by most companies, and they will deliver substantial benefits rapidly.</p>
<p>""The drivers of competitive advantage are always evolving. Not long ago, quality was a fringe idea and IT was just a cost center. Now quality is table stakes, and fluency with big data is mission-critical. Energy is on a similar tajectory. What was once the hidden deep in procurement is rising to take its place among the key levers of business success.""</p>

1109,"Blockchain: The basis for disruptive innovation in the energy sector?",NULL,NULL,"
<p>Blockchain technology has passed its peak in the hype process – at least according to Gartner Consulting’s well-known hype cycles for emerging technologies. In the second quarter of 2017, blockchain technology has passed the peak of inflated expectations and is now on its way down towards the phase of disillusionment.</p>

<p>Figure 1: Hype cycle of emerging technologies (source: Gardner, 2017)</p>
<p>Regardless of the question whether the hype really has reached its peak, blockchain technology potentially changes how different business processes are executed, e.g. financial transactions or electricity trade. With today’s post we want to build on our previous introduction of the theory of disruptive innovation as it was defined by Clayton Christensen (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.claytonchristensen.com/books/the-innovators-dilemma/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">1997</a>) and apply this theory to try and answer the question whether blockchain technology is a disruptive innovation for the energy sector. If you are not familiar with the basic concept of blockchain technology we strongly recommend to first <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.enerquire.com/blog/blockchain-in-the-energy-sector-the-institutional-side"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">read&nbsp;this post here</a>&nbsp;and then proceed with this post.</p>
<p>In our last post we have already introduced the theory of disruptive innovation as it was defined by Clayton Christensen in his book “The Innovators Dilemma” (1997). We will only sum up the key elements of the theoretical concept here and recommend&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.enerquire.com/blog/disruptive-innovations-in-the-energy-sector-definition-application"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">this post</a>&nbsp;for a more detailed introduction of the concept.</p>

<h3>Disruptive innovations in a nutshell</h3>
<p>In general, Christensen differentiates between two types of innovations: sustaining innovations that improve your product and disruptive innovations, that replace your product with a cheaper, more convenient or better product from the customers’ perspective. More recently,&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2015/12/02/fresh-insights-from-clayton-christensen-on-disruptive-innovation/#7f65e8864702"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Christensen (2015)</a>&nbsp;added efficiency innovations to this basic structure. Efficiency innovations aim at cost reductions (making more with less) and are actually quite important in the age of digitalization and automation.</p>
<p>Still, from Christensen’s perspective an innovation only then qualifies as disruptive if an innovation enters an existing market at the low-end side, meaning that it is less convenient to use, &nbsp;is of poor quality compared to the premium products in the market and generates lower revenues than the premium products in the same market. For incumbents, these low-end products are less interesting, as they offer smaller rate-of-returns than their existing premium products. Therefore, they do not invest much (if any) capital into the low-end market product.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the innovation addresses similar consumer needs as do the incumbents’ products in the established market, but it can still open up a new market as it adds new features that go beyond the characteristics of the established products.</p>
<p>An innovation that started from the low-end or a new market then becomes a disruptive innovation if it conquers the mass-market and drives the incumbents’ customers to switch products. Then, the revenue of the incumbent shrinks quite dramatically, which in the end results in a disruption of the incumbents’ business model.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Blockchain lays the foundation for disruptive innovation – but does not qualify as a disruptive innovation itself</h3>
<p>Blockchain is a fundamental technology, just like the TCP/IP protocol was and still is. For those of you who are interested in the similarities of these technologies we recommend to take a look at this article by&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Iansiti &amp; Lakhani (2017)</a>&nbsp;who provide a nice comparison of blockchain and the TCP/IP protocol. While the TCP/IP protocol provided an open and shared public network to exchange information at very low costs, the blockchain now provides an open (in case of public blockchains that is) and shared public network to execute transactions at low costs (at least in the future).</p>
<p>For our analysis here it is important to note that not the TCP/IP protocol disrupted traditional business models, but the applications that made use of this infrastructure did. Amazon sold books via internet and with this concept challenged normal book-stores, Expedia offered travel services online etc. Similarly, blockchain itself will not disrupt business models, but the applications that make use of this new technology might. Even if applications make use of the blockchain, they might result in sustaining or efficiency innovations, e.g. by reducing the costs of transactions, increasing the speed of processes etc. So the fact that an application is based on the blockchain technology does not imply that the application is disruptive, nor is the blockchain technology itself a disruptive innovation.</p>
<p>Actually, what we can see in the financial sector is that most large financial institutions are currently investigating and testing first blockchain applications. If the incumbents apply blockchain technology to reduce costs, increase efficiency and improve customer services, then it is likely that these applications will result in sustaining or efficiency innovations - which is fine by the way. Not every innovation has to be disruptive, actually, very few are.</p>
<p>As we are already on the topic of finance: BitCoin is one of those applications that make use of the blockchain. Whether BitCoin will become a disruptive innovation for conventional currencies remains an open debate. So far, cryptocurrencies, most prominently BitCoin, are not yet accepted as currencies in the formal way (only in Japan BitCoin is an official currency). We will see in the coming years whether BitCoin has the potential to disrupt the currency market. Though this is an interesting topic, we won’t dive deeper into this here, as this is discussion only marginally effects the energy supply chain for now. If this changes, we will of course pick up the issue of cryptocurrencies in the energy sector on this blog.</p>
<p>For the ones being active in the energy sector the interesting question then is: Where can we expect that applications based on the blockchain technology disrupt the energy industry?</p>
<h3>Blockchain applications in the energy sector - where disruption could happen</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that disruptive innovations start at the low-end market and need some time to conquer the mass-market, it is not possible from today’s perspective to identify the future disruptive blockchain technologies, simply, because the technology is not ready yet and far away from entering the mass-market, at least in the energy sector.</p>
<p>Still, what we can do is to take a look at the energy supply chain and try to identify the areas where the risk of low-end market or new market entries is high. Recall, for an innovation to be disruptive the incumbent needs to have a premium product with high revenues on which he focuses its innovation process and thereby ignores the low-end or new market addressed by the innovation. So where in the energy supply chain can we find such incumbent products with high revenues that might be disrupted by blockchain applications?</p>
<h3>Blockchain-enabled applications in the generation sector</h3>
<p>Generation was fundamental for the utility business model in the last century. As we have discussed in a&nbsp;previous post&nbsp;this traditional business model is already challenged (and potentially disrupted, yes) by renewables. Still, generation companies like Uniper (the conventional business that evolved out of E.on in 2014) or RWE rely on generation assets for their revenues and remain to do so for the next years. Is generation a field where we could expect blockchain technology to facilitate new applications that might disrupt the utilities’ business model? Possibly! The key feature of all blockchain-based applications is the fast and direct execution of transactions without intermediaries. As a stand-alone solution, this feature is not yet challenging the generators’ business case. However, the blockchain technologies offer the potential to address one of the key challenges for renewables that hinder them from taking over further market shares from conventional generators: it is the access to markets. More specifically, most markets where flexibility from renewables or demand can generate sufficient revenues are not accessible for small-scale distributed resources. In most flexibility markets, in the US as well as in Europe, you can only participate with a capacity of 500 kW, 1 MW or even 5 MW. Most photovoltaic power plants are far smaller, in Germany a photovoltaic power plant has an average size of less than 50kW. Therefore, distributed renewables and especially photovoltaics cannot access the existing flexibility markets (leaving aside the question whether they have a financial incentive to do so). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, blockchain applications, especially those that aim at P2P trading, decrease potential market entry barriers and open up new markets (e.g. selling electricity to neighbors) for distributed generators. The Brooklyn Microgrid in New York and PowerLedger in Australia are the most prominent examples for such P2P applications. Recently, Tennet has started a cooperation with Sonnen and together they aim at a blockchain-enabled aggregation of distributed battery storage for ancillary services (more details can be found&nbsp;here).&nbsp;These projects are developing the next level of virtual power plants that eventually will be able to adapt production and feed-in into the grid according to price signals or requirements by the network operators. Thereby, blockchain-based applications might unlock flexibility markets for distributed generators. If this application proves to be feasible, blockchain-based applications might offer the potential to disrupt the generators’ core business model. Whether this will actually be the case depends on two factors:</p>
<ol> 	<li>The potential applications that are based on blockchain technology need to develop into real business cases.</li> 	<li>Utilities that still rely on the revenues from conventional generation must ignore these applications, even though they might have a positive business case. This will only be the case if the ROI for the new application will be significantly lower than is the ROI for conventional generation.</li> </ol>
<h3>Blockchain applications in the network sector</h3>
<p>Network ownership and operation are regulated tasks. Therefore, they are less exposed to disruptive innovations. Especially, as each innovation needs to be signed off by the regulator. Therefore, blockchain applications like any other innovation are not likely to disrupt the network operators’ business model. Still, blockchain-based applications for network operation might soon become relevant, especially in combination with IoT applications. It is very likely that IoT and blockchain applications will result in efficiency innovations for network operations, under an innovation friendly regulation this might even increase the revenue from the networks, but heavily depends on the regulatory scheme.</p>
<h3>Blockchain applications in the retail business</h3>
<p>Retail is the second pillar of the incumbent utilities market-based business model. Already today, retail business is under pressure from competition, at least in those markets that have introduced retail competition. For now, utilities remain big players in this business, but the retail sector is and will be the part of the energy supply chain that is targeted by most blockchain applications currently developed in the energy sector. Basically, P2P applications aim at eliminating the retailer and allow consumers to bilaterally trade electricity on a local level without any intermediary in-between. The approaches mentioned above, like the Brooklyn Micro Grid as well as PowerLedger have the primary aim to develop a blockchain application that eliminates retailers. Here, the potential for disruption from blockchain-based business models seems to be the largest for now and the concepts are the most advanced ones as well. However, we are still waiting for the large-scale proof-of-concept of these applications. If this is achieved by one of the concepts out there, pressure on the retailers’ business model will increase significantly and yes, might be disrupted as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Blockchain applications might disrupt the energy sector, but not as a whole</h3>

<p>What we can conclude from the scenario described above is that the blockchain technology itself cannot be considered to be a disruptive innovation. Rather, it seems likely that the blockchain technology will provide the basis for new applications that might have the potential to disrupt certain stages of the energy supply chain. Most prominently, generation and retail might rather soon face disruptive powers from blockchain-based applications. Now that the hype about blockchain has passed the peak we will see in the near future of 5 years in what direction the first blockchain-based applications with positive business cases will evolve. The question then is: Will utilities pick up these new applications and thereby turn them into sustaining or efficiency innovations, or will the utilities stick to their current core business models with (potentially) higher ROI and thereby increase the chance of disruption?</p>

1110,"Roundtable on Financing Industrial Energy Efficiency, October 19th",NULL,NULL,"<h3>October 19th, Brussels - Roundtable on Financing Industrial Energy Efficiency &nbsp;</h3>

<p><strong>On October 19th there will be a special invitation only roundtable to</strong></p>
<p><strong>discuss EEFIG (Energy Efficiency Institutions Group) recommendations and how the industrial sector fits into </strong></p>
<p><strong>the EU’s overall energy efficiency strategy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There is <strong>limited space</strong> but if you would like more information and would like to attend, please contact me at <a class=""mail"" href=""mailto:rod.janssen@ee-ip.org"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">rod.janssen@ee-ip.org</a>. </strong></p>

<p>The clean energy package that is currently going through the approval process within EU institutions gives considerable attention to energy efficiency. For industry, there are no legislative changes being recommended. The reliance is in continuing the implementation of the articles in the 2012 Energy Efficiency Directive. These relate largely to mandatory energy audits for large companies, promotion of energy management systems and support for SMEs.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG), created in 2014, is taking up much of the policy discussions relating to industrial energy efficiency. EEFIG identified many of the barriers to the long-term financing for energy efficiency and proposed policy recommendations and market solutions to them. The purpose of the group is to get the financial institutions and other relevant stakeholders to help find ways to overcome the investment blockage. There is financing available, but banks have poor capacity and interest to finance energy efficiency, and consumers (in this case industry or businesses or institutions) are reluctant to decide to undertake such measures. While there are some investments, for sure, they are not at a scale that will have a real impact that is needed to meet our long-term objectives. One of the problems is that there is a lack of standardisation in project development and documentation and that is seen as one of the major barriers to increasing investment into energy efficiency.</p>
<p>The members of EEFIG identified a clear opportunity to dramatically grow and improve energy efficiency investments in Europe’s industrial and non-industrial companies of all sizes to deliver competitive advantages globally and locally. EEFIG identified a need to raise the priority of energy efficiency at executive board level, incorporate energy efficiency investments within the standard corporate finance dialogue and process and to encourage firms to be more open with the investment horizons, scope and returns for energy efficiency investments which they will accept. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The 2015 Final Report of EEFIG provided the following recommendations concerning industry:</strong></p>

<ul> 	<li>The policy framework should positively support strong corporate energy efficiency investment choices at key points in their investment cycle</li> 	<li>Public resources and facilitation should be engaged to establish dynamic and effective systems for sharing information and technical experience</li> 	<li>Ensure EU and national policies and resources are working effectively together to drive R&amp;D and optimal energy efficiency outcomes</li> 	<li>Support the clarification of the regulatory, fiscal and accounting treatment and standardisation of Energy Performance Contracts</li> 	<li>Energy efficiency opportunity identification and investible project pipelines should be supported with Project Development Assistance facilities for SMEs &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p>EEFIG [link - <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.eefig.com/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">http://www.eefig.com/</a>] has helped raise the profile of industrial energy efficiency but these recommendations remain, for the most part, unfulfilled. <strong>On October 19th there will be a special invitation only roundtable to discuss these recommendations and how the industrial sector fits into the EU’s overall energy efficiency strategy</strong>. There is an excellent group of panellists that will discuss some of the crucial issues facing policymakers and practitioners.&nbsp; Some of the issues under discussion include:</p>
<ul> 	<li>What will be the impact of further efforts to “de-risk” investments? Is there room for further standardization of the investment process?</li> 	<li>How can the “perceived” risk been brought down to the “real risk?</li> 	<li>How do we encourage industry to consider energy efficiency investments as strategic decisions for improving their overall competitiveness?</li> 	<li>What more can be done to ensure economic energy efficiency measures are implemented?</li> 	<li>How do we motivate more private investment activity for financing industrial energy efficiency?&nbsp; Is there the possibility of bundling projects to reduce transaction costs and make them more interesting to financial institutions?</li> 	<li>Have the mandatory audits under the Energy Efficiency Directive led to significant investments? If not, why?&nbsp; If not, how?</li> 	<li>Can policy changes at EU or national levels encourage more investment in industrial energy efficiency measures? &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p>These are important issues and following the roundtable, Chairman’s Conclusions will be prepared and distributed to members of the EU institutions and relevant stakeholders.</p>

1111,"New recording of energy performance contracts (EPCs) in government accounts",NULL,NULL,"<h3>New recording of energy performance contracts (EPCs) in government accounts &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Recently Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, published <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/1015035/7959867/Eurostat-Guidance-Note-Recording-Energy-Perform-Contracts-Gov-Accounts.pdf/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">new guidance on recording of energy performance contracts in government accounts.</a> This could have a <strong>big impact on investments in energy efficiency in the public sector.</strong>&nbsp; Most of these investments are on the energy demand side but EPC projects may also include additional services related to efficient energy supply. &nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/EU (EED), Energy Performance Contracting ""means a contractual arrangement between the beneficiary and the provider of an energy efficiency improvement measure, verified and monitored during the whole term of the contract, where investments (work, supply or service) in that measure are paid for in relation to a contractually agreed level of energy efficiency improvement or other agreed energy performance criterion, such as financial savings."" &nbsp;</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, energy performance contracts have gained in importance as policymakers and investors look for ways to ensure a better flow of financing. For the European Union this started with the SAVE directive in 1993, where Article 4 stated: “Member States shall draw up and implement programmes to permit third-party financing for energy efficiency investments in the public sector. For the purposes of this Directive, 'third-party financing' means the overall provision of auditing, installation, operation, maintenance and financing services for an energy efficiency investment, with recovery of the cost of these services being contingent, either wholly or in part, on the level of energy savings.”[1] This was replaced more than a decade later but the point is that it got member states actively assessing the role that third-party financing and energy performance contracting could play in the public sector. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>New guidance from Eurostat &nbsp;</h3>
<p>While there was guidance published a few years ago, it is good to see that Eurostat published new guidance in September. The revised guidance note clarifies the accounting rules applied to the treatment of energy performance contracts. It follows up on the work already undertaken by Eurostat to clarify the accounting rules for various types of public investment, including the Guide to the Statistical Treatment of Public Private Partnerships published last year. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Energy performance contracts in the public sector offer a practical solution to make public buildings and other public infrastructures more energy efficient, as the initial investment can be covered by a private partner and repaid by guaranteed energy savings.</strong> However, frequently this type of contract simultaneously contains elements of a rental, service, lease, purchase or loan agreement, making its recording complex. At the request of Member States, Eurostat has worked with National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) to reflect on the most appropriate recording of EPCs in government accounts. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Eurostat guidance note on the accounting treatment of EPCs significantly increases the possibilities for public bodies to use such contracts, by including and clarifying the circumstance in which these contracts can be recorded off government balance sheets.</strong> It also paves the way for the development of a stronger market of EPC providers, involving many SMEs. According to data collected by European PPP Expertise Centre (EPEC), over the last five years 345 new public-private partnership projects concerning energy performance were signed in 16 EU Member States, for the total <strong>value of over €65 billion.</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>EPCs where the energy efficiency is obtained through energy management measures, without any investment in equipment addition or renewal, are treated as simple service or maintenance contracts. This revised guidance is applied in cases where the EPC-contractor can be considered as the economic owner of the asset, where EPCs require an initial capital expenditure to improve the energy efficiency of a facility. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>What does this mean for the new phase of the Investor Confidence Project for Industry, District Energy and Street lighting? &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The Investor Confidence Project Europe, funded by the European Commission, is designed to unlock access to financing for the building, industry, district energy and street lighting markets by standardising how energy efficiency projects are developed, documented and measured. &nbsp;Standardisation using best practices set out by ICP reduces the risk for investors in regard to the projected outcome of an energy efficiency project. It also reduces time and skills needed by investors to perform due diligence for each individual project. Finally, it reduces transaction costs.&nbsp; These factors open the door for more capital to finance such projects or re-finance investments of project developers and ESCOs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Street lighting, to a large extent, and district energy, to a lesser extent, involve public bodies. The new guidance for EPCs can be an important way for integrating it with the IPC approach, since EPCs can certainly be used for IPC projects. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The European Commission has already funded a project looking at street lighting and EPCs. This is important for increasing the awareness of how EPCs can help in the investment decisions for lighting upgrades. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Short summary of ICP &nbsp;</h3>
<p>ICP (Investor Confidence Project Europe) delivers a standardised framework for developing energy efficiency projects to reduce uncertainty for clients and investors – to help grow the number of projects and the energy efficiency finance market. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ICP is based on two foundations: </strong></p>
<ol> 	<li><em>The ICP framework </em><br /> 	The ICP framework assembles best practices and existing technical standards into a set of Protocols that define a clear roadmap for developing projects, determining savings estimates, and documenting and verifying results.<br /> 	&nbsp;</li> 	<li><em>Independent 3rd party certification</em><br /> 	ICP's Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ (IREE™) is an international certification that insures best practices, the right professionals and third-party validation are used to deliver high-quality projects that you can bank on. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li> </ol>
<h3>Where are we now? &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The current ICP project for industry, district energy and street lighting started in May 2017. The first phase concerns industry but the next phase on district energy and street lighting will start early 2018.&nbsp; The industry phase includes development of the protocols taking advantage of the expertise of a large group of experts and then testing the system through pilot projects. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Soon, ICP will be setting up separate technical forums for district energy and for street lighting to help in the development of protocols. If you would like to be included, please visit our website. Also, importantly we would like your reaction to the guidance from Eurostat on EPCs and whether you see this as a major breakthrough to help increase investments for district energy and street lighting.</p>

1112,"Artificial Intelligence in Energy Management Software",NULL,NULL,"<p><strong>This is not a blog about AI, machine learning or even deep learning. </strong></p>
<p>It is about a quick review on how far energy management software (EMS) has developed over the last years. And if we can see first signs that applications are now embedded in EMS which some would refer to as based on or using AI or machine learning.</p>
<h3>Basic level EMS</h3>
<p>There seems to be broad consensus about the basics of EMS: the software should be able to</p>
<ol> 	<li>Collect data automatically via different interfaces and from different applications</li> 	<li>Process data quickly and provide it as a basis for decisions and actions</li> 	<li>Be integrated in exisiting systems and processes using existing bus systems, protocols and standards</li> 	<li>Support the rules of the overall energy management system via automated actions</li> 	<li>Ideally also allow for forcasting</li> 	<li>Send alarm signals for certain pre-defined parameters</li> </ol>
<p>And yes, there is also broad consensus that such a software is a prerequisite for long-term success of energy management. Although excel sheets are still used in industry. But this is another story.</p>
<h3>Use cases: The link between energy management and IIoT</h3>
<p>IIoT (industrial internet of things) is often referred to as the driver for the next industrial revolution. A number of use cases are defined to showcase the benefits of IIoT. Some of them are rather easy to understand, think of ""predictive maintenance"", some are more difficult to think about and to develop, e.g. ""new business models"". And energy efficiency is also mentioned as one of the obvious (and easy to understand) use cases.</p>
<p>But whatever IIoT use case you think about, they have one thing in common. We are always talking about big data. And big data is the foundation for any AI, machine learning etc application.</p>
<p>So where are big data based AI or machine learning applications when looking at energy management software?</p>
<p>Or to re-phrase the question: what AI/machine learning applications would be most obvious or would deliver highest benefit?</p>
<h3>We are no AI experts, but...</h3>
<p>We spoke with various different vendors of energy management software. And we found only one we believe touched on it: <strong><a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.ingsoft.de/energy_management_software_IngSoft_InterWatt_en.ingsoft?channel=print&amp;ActiveID=1931"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">IngSoft and the ""automatic pattern recognition</a>""</strong></p>
<p>According to IngSoft, this new functionality can detect irregular energy consumption data automatically, allows to identify causes immediately and to react upon. We have not spoken with IngSoft about how they do it and how deep the software integration needs to be to allow for such pattern recognition. So clearly we are also interested in feedback from companies using this new application.</p>
<p>In parallel, I discussed with IBM on an event in Brussels about ""Energy Efficiency: the AI factor"" industrial uses cases for the IBM Watson AI platform. Although impressive examples were shown, these were mostly around the management of technical information rather than focussing on energy management. But we stay in touch with IBM as the promised us to refer us to more use cases. Potentially also ones with a loink to energy management.</p>
<p>Another initiative we came across is the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.kipro-projekt.de/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">German <strong>Project KiPro</strong></a>, funded by the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.bmwi.de/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology</a>. KiPro stands for ""Künstliche Intelligenz in der Produktion"" (in ENG that would mean ""AI in Production""). The objective of KiPro is to develop AI supported platforms to assist production to improve energy efficiency. It is based on EMS collecting the data but then applying AI applications to support ""humans"" in their decision making. Well, automatic pattern recognition sounds like one possible use case, right? But there are likely more.</p>
<h3>Outlook: AI &amp; energy management software</h3>
<p>This is a call to open the debate. Tell us what you think will be the next big ""AI EMS thing"". Or just direct us to intersting companies or examples as we are always keen to present them to a broad EEIP audience.</p>

1114,"Towards Zero Emission Mobility in European Transport",NULL,NULL,"


<p>Thirteen</p>
<p>companies and industry associations from European industry have joined forces</p>
<p>and identified key tasks on the upcoming European Union Low Emission Mobility</p>
<p>Package.</p>



<p>Representing</p>
<p>the zero-emission mobility industry, thirteen companies see the second part of</p>
<p>the ‘Europe on the Move’ mobility package announced for November as a unique</p>
<p>opportunity for the European Union to once again lead the shift to decarbonise</p>
<p>vehicles. By proposing an ambitious car and van CO2 regulation for post 2020,</p>
<p>the EU would drive jobs, growth and innovation across the economy.</p>



<p>The EU</p>
<p>has agreed a long-term vision that should drive emissions reductions and has</p>
<p>signed the Paris Agreement which requires signatory countries to limit global</p>
<p>temperature rise by cutting overall emissions by 80 to 95 percent by 2050. In</p>
<p>order to achieve this, all light duty vehicles must be zero emission by 2050.</p>
<p>As vehicles stay an average of 15 years in the market, 100% of sales need to be</p>
<p>zero emission by 2035. On the basis of this, the governments of France, the UK,</p>
<p>the Netherlands, Norway and Austria have publicly announced the phasing- out of</p>
<p>combustion engines well before 2050.</p>



<p>To help</p>
<p>make this happen and to accelerate Zero Emission Vehicle sales the EU needs to</p>
<p>set a 2-fold policy in the November package:</p>



<p>First, to</p>
<p>accelerate Zero Emission Vehicles deployment, the EU needs to set a mandatory</p>
<p>sales target for 2025 and 2030. The transport sector accounts for 33% of final</p>
<p>energy consumption in the EU. It continues to struggle to reduce CO2 emissions</p>
<p>(emissions in 2014 were 300 megatons greater than in 1990) and oil dependency</p>
<p>(the EU imports 87% of crude oil and road transport consumes 47% of the total)</p>
<p>and to improve energy efficiency. Combustion-based transport also negatively</p>
<p>affects urban air quality: 5.4% of deaths in Europe are due to air pollution. Zero</p>
<p>Emission Vehicles contribute towards providing the clean, energy-efficient and</p>
<p>affordable transport needed to reduce emissions.</p>



<p>Second,</p>
<p>the EU should set ambitious CO2 targets for 2025 and 2030 for cars, vans, and</p>
<p>in 2018 also for lorries and busses. CO2 targets for cars and vans have proven</p>
<p>to be the single most important driver for car manufacturers to produce cleaner</p>
<p>cars. They form the basis for technology neutral emission reductions in the</p>
<p>road transport sector. CO2 emission targets for road vehicles should be set in</p>
<p>such a way that emission reductions of 9% annually are achieved by 2030, the</p>
<p>levels needed to meet the Paris Agreement goals.</p>



<p>Zero</p>
<p>Emission Vehicles are now a mature technology, ready to scale up to mass</p>
<p>market. This is confirmed by many car makers’ recent announcements that they</p>
<p>intend to widen their Zero Emission Vehicle offers, i.e. battery electric and</p>
<p>fuel-cell vehicles. The current range of Zero Emission Vehicles is between 200</p>
<p>and 450 km, with the total cost of ownership expected to fall below the</p>
<p>internal combustion engine equivalent by the early 2020s. A significant</p>
<p>condition for mass market uptake is a high-power charging network, as well as</p>
<p>supporting hydrogen refuelling infrastructure, along and beyond the TEN-T Core</p>
<p>Network. Building a sufficiently dense normal and fast charging network</p>
<p>enabling the parking and charging of vehicles also drives the deployment of</p>
<p>shared, more efficient and connected mobility, which in turn enhances the</p>
<p>electrification of vehicles.</p>



<p>By</p>
<p>setting a Zero Emission Vehicle target, in combination with very ambitious 2025</p>
<p>and 2030 CO2 standards driving vehicle electrification, the EU would support a</p>
<p>growing domestic zero- emission mobility industry with high innovative</p>
<p>potential which would return the EU to being among the leaders in this field.</p>
<p>Recent studies suggest that promoting the shift to electric vehicles would lead</p>
<p>to a 1% increase in EU GDP, and create up to 2 million additional jobs by 2050</p>
<p>(850.000 by 2030) in the wider economy due to an increased automotive suppliers</p>
<p>value chain and higher demand on energy supply. In order for Europe to lead in</p>
<p>the uptake of electric vehicles it will be crucial to drive innovation efforts</p>
<p>towards the next generation of batteries and fuel cells, coupled with policy</p>
<p>encouraging their performance and the development of EU-based technology</p>
<p>know-how (e.g. energy density, better use of raw material and chemicals, lower</p>
<p>carbon foot print, safety, recycling, refuelling/charging speed).</p>





<p>Without</p>
<p>creating a sufficiently large integrated market for Zero Emission Vehicles in</p>
<p>Europe, growth and value added will remain confined to other world regions.</p>
<p>China has already announced a Zero Emission Vehicle mandate from 2019 onwards,</p>
<p>aiming at 20% of all sales by 20256. The EU now has an excellent opportunity to</p>
<p>ensure it does not fall behind by equally introducing a quota – studies have</p>
<p>indicated that a similar quota of around 20% by 2025 would be appropriate.</p>





<p>This is</p>
<p>an opportunity for the European Union to lead boldly during this transition</p>
<p>with many uncertainties by sending a strong signal to European industry and to</p>
<p>European citizens. Representatives of the zero-emission mobility industry</p>
<p>remain committed to working with the EU to ensure that the ‘Europe on the Move’</p>
<p>mobility package unleashes its full potential.</p>

<p>Europe has been experimenting with how to unlock the potential of industry so that all European society benefits. One tried and true way is to improve the energy performance of industry.&nbsp; <strong>But, energy efficiency is not difficult but it is complicated!</strong> And it takes investment in all but the so-called low-hanging fruit. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>EEFIG industry event</h3>

<p>This week an important event took place in Brussels: industry raised its voice to express the importance of all efforts to promote improvements in their energy performance. <strong>Key is in improving the flow of investments.</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The event was under the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.eefig.com/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG)</a>, which was established in 2013 by the European Commission Directorate-General for Energy and United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative. EEFIG provided an open dialogue and work platform for public and private financial institutions, industry representatives and sector experts to identify the barriers to the long-term financing for energy efficiency and propose policy and market solutions to them.&nbsp; EEFIG covered both the buildings and industry sectors.&nbsp; The meeting this week focused on industry.&nbsp; The meeting was facilitated by the rapporteur of EEFIG, Peter Sweatman of Climate Strategy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The first theme looked at efforts to de-risk investment and there are many good examples. It also considered how to get industry to consider investments in industry efficiency as strategic investments as they do for many of their other investments that increase production. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The next steps</strong></p>
<p>The second theme concerns moving forward.&nbsp; The 2012 EU Energy Efficiency Directive provided many measures to encourage industrial energy efficiency: mandatory audits for large industry, promotion of energy management systems and supporting SMEs. Now, it is a matter of how to ensure cost-effective measures are identified and implemented. Also it is important to know what can be done to encourage private investment in industrial measures. Also, it is</p>
<p>important to have some understanding of what the impact was of the mandatory audits (example: the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/articles/detailed/999325585c33f81f2b421390498a8124/energy-audit-in-smes-could-unlock-great-energy-efficiency-potential-in-europe-a-focus-on-the-italia/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">post from Silvia Zinetti ""Energy Audit in SMEs..""</a>). &nbsp; The discussion was robust and it highlighted that it is important for focused discussions on aspects of industrial energy efficiency. This is less common in Brussels than it should be.&nbsp; There was a lot of discussion about the need for transparency:&nbsp; amongst companies to share experience in improving efficiency as well as within companies between management and the technical teams. Importantly, the energy efficiency networks well known in countries such as Germany were shown as an important approach for improving transparency (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/articles/detailed/9cd5dcf4d5ddf42d2b30ff99cbe48c70/how-icp-can-contribute-to-the-success-of-energy-efficiency-networks/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">more about energy efficiency networks here</a>).</p>
<p>There was also a good discussion about how to address “perceived” risk versus “real” risks.&nbsp; Curiously, there was no agreement whether companies should share experience on their energy use in their processes.&nbsp; Is this a competitive issue? No doubt it will be explored more. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There was discussion on the drivers that lead to energy efficiency improvements. Understandably that leads to the role of government at all levels. Again, this discussion will definitely continue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Importantly, everyone learned something. There were many examples of financial instruments or experience at the factory level that surprised most of us since these were new revelations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Soon, there will be Chairman’s Conclusions</strong> that will be widely distributed to all EU institutions, the wider industrial community and all other stakeholders. This is important for these audiences to hear what the industrial and financial communities are saying. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This meeting was important for Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes because it validates its call for regular dialogue on industrial energy efficiency. While being a neutral and open, business and policy platform, it is essential that the voice of industry be heard.&nbsp; The low-carbon energy transition is underway and it is important for industry. There is much to discuss. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There is much to do. EEIP is proud to be a member of EEFIG and continue seeking solutions that will unlock financing to ensure more of the cost-effective potential for improvements is achieved. To achieve those ends, EEIP is also a member of a Consortium implementing the EU-funded <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Investor Confidence Project</a> for Industry, District Energy and Street lighting (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/articles/detailed/53342740eae28d5ee08e107a0b057533/icp-top-2-benefits-for-energy-efficiency-project-developers/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">more about benefits for project developers here</a>). This project unlocks access to financing by standardising how energy efficiency projects are developed, documented and measured. &nbsp;</p>

1116,"Standards for industrial energy efficiency projects - the importance of technical integrity",NULL,NULL,"<h3>The Investor Confidence Project: The importance of technical integrity &nbsp; &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The <strong>Investor Confidence Project</strong>, funded by the European Commission, was brought to Europe to develop a system to give confidence to all active stakeholders. There are still concerns that investing in energy efficiency is risky. ICP Europe is designed to change that. Starting with investments in buildings, ICP Europe has now broadened the scope to include industry (large and small), district energy and street lighting.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently the second meeting of the Technical Forum was held via a webinar (26.10.2017) to help develop the protocol for industry projects. The protocols represent the backbone of the ICP concept, as will be explained below. <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/industry-tech-forum-resources.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>Here you can listen to the webinar recording</strong></a> and here you can <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/technical-forum.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>join the Technical Forum</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The Technical Forum ensures that ICP Europe staff is producing relevant and needed products and services for the European energy efficiency markets. The Forum shall do this through: &nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li>Providing insight and feedback on draft products in webinar based Forum meetings and informally;</li> 	<li>Providing local, national and European knowledge on relevant standards, best practices and initiatives that may be relevant to, or interact with, ICP Europe products and tools; and</li> 	<li>dentifying projects and programmes for piloting of ICP Europe products and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p>Currently, there are about 70 members of the Technical Forum.&nbsp; They are now providing their feedback to the draft Protocols and then they will come back to meet again to review the final draft at the end of November. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Understanding the importance of the protocols &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Experts play a valuable role in developing new protocols for industry, district energy and street lighting. The Protocols define a standardised road map of best practices for originating energy savings following the ICP Project Lifecycle.&nbsp; ICP Protocols are an industry best practice assembly of existing standards, practices, and documentation in order to create the data necessary to enable underwriting or managing of energy performance risk.&nbsp; ICP Europe works with the European Technical Forum to develop protocols that are designed to address the range of typical industry (large and small), district energy and street lighting projects found in the European market.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>These <strong>protocols reference international, European and national standards and best practices</strong> to provide all market actors across the European energy efficiency development and investment community with tools <strong>to improve the predictability of energy savings and related bankability of energy efficiency projects</strong>. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>How the ICP process works &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The concept of the Investor Confidence Project is simple to understand. The protocols set out requirements for an investment package to be submitted by a project developer which covers critical stages throughout the project lifecycle. This documentation is subsequently reviewed by a third party Quality Assurance Provider. Compliant projects are awarded the Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ certification. This process enables standardised project performance underwriting, leading to better data on performance, and a more efficient marketplace with less duplicative engineering and lower transaction costs. The result should be an increase in deal flow and a more transparent and efficient market.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, a potential project in a factory or a district energy system is identified. Someone has to do the necessary calculations to determine the viability. Someone has to be identified to install it (often the same organisation). And some organisation needs to fund it. What this project does is standardise the procedures so that all players gain confidence in the system. The factory owner is happy. The developer/auditor/installer is happy. The financial institution is happy. There is third party monitoring to ensure everything is done correctly. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>The technical integrity of the protocol &nbsp;</h3>
<p>If the protocol is not credible and technically worthy, then the entire ICP concept fails. For that reason, it is important to have a strong body providing technical guidance.&nbsp; On the ICP team, the people writing the draft protocols have years of experience and are technically sound. But, we understand that a transparent and open, multi-stakeholder approach to the process, where we try to make sure to collect enough EU representativeness to make sure protocols are applicable in all EU markets, is key to their acceptance and usefulness. For that reason, ICP has always used a group of experts to provide comments and advice. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Technical Forum for industry, there are about 70 members from throughout Europe. These are experts in industrial energy efficiency. As the terms of reference states: “The membership of the Forum is open to all interested parties that currently work in energy efficiency and shall consist of experienced individuals who work within organizations that are leaders themselves in the various constituency groups that make up the European energy efficiency marketplace – namely investors, building and asset owners, energy efficiency project developers, vendors of energy efficiency equipment and services, NGOs and government agencies.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the questions discussed during the second technical forum included: &nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li>Should there be one or two protocols – one for complex and one for targeted or is it better to have one integrated protocol? &nbsp;&nbsp;</li> </ul>
<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""351"" height=""401"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/f07e9adf7d.png"" width=""859"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<ul> 	<li>With energy audits being the starting point of any energy efficiency project under a best practice, should these be a mandatory requirement?</li> 	<li>Is there a plan to trial the protocols on real projects?</li> 	<li>How will the protocols be applied to different industrial sectors?</li> 	<li>How can the benefits of the ICP process be communicated to investors?</li> 	<li>What is the overlap between the ICP protocols and IPMVP (International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol)?</li> 	<li>How should non-energy related cost savings be considered in the protocols?&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Should the protocols consider primary energy as well as final energy?</li> 	<li>What experience should process specialist be required to have? &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p>These and many other issues were raised.&nbsp; The technical team is now encouraging members of the Technical Forum to come forward with more comments. <strong>The protocols will be revised and, following a third meeting of the Technical Forum near the end of November</strong>, will be published the first week of December. Again, you can still join the Technical Forum to engage or at least be amongst the first with full information about what is coming. <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/technical-forum.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">You can join Technical Forum here.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Next steps &nbsp;</h3>

1117,"Energy Data Insights: The Missing “Smart Step” to Better Building Performance",NULL,NULL,"
<p>Following our last article on ""<a href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/articles/detailed/6aca03305a9634e44c6fa7393b5fd384/artificial-intelligence-in-energy-management-software/""><strong>Artificial Intelligence in Energy Management Software</strong></a>"", we got many responses from vendors and users alike. Over the next couple of weeks and month we will follow them all up and present here what we do believe are relevant and smart new solutions.</p>
<p>As EEIP we are having a particular focus on solutions not only delivering a higher return but are adressing (and solving) a specific barrier in the market.</p>
<p>Dexma showed us a new solution based on the <strong>insight of the ""2 steps to energy efficiency""</strong>. Basically it means that you need to equip someone within a company with some arguments to kick-off an energy audit. And arguments here means real savings potential. Plus, there is also a link to artificial intelligence as the <strong>new solution also uses pattern recognition algorithms</strong> to automatically recommend different technical solutions.</p>
<h3>How the new AI platform works: check during live walkthrough webinar (recording)</h3>
<p>On <strong>Thursday, 9th of November</strong>, Dexma Product Director Daniel Utges showed the solution during a webinar including a live walkthrough. You can <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://get.dexmatech.com/frictionless-energy-savings-energygrader?utm_campaign=EnergyGrader%20Launch%202017&amp;utm_source=Referral&amp;utm_medium=EEIP"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">register here</a> - or after the 9th November use this link to view the recording.</p>
<p>The solution is mainly targeted for <strong>buildings energy performance</strong>, so let´s start with a brief&nbsp; background</p>
<h3>Barriers to Buildings Performance</h3>
<p>A large and necessary step in achieving the Paris Agreement requires a transition to a highly efficient building stock in terms of real energy performance. This is perhaps nowhere more true than in Europe, where it is often stated that “<strong>all buildings built before 1990 are inefficient</strong>” and that <strong>up to 75% need renovating</strong> in order to reach a higher energy efficiency standard. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to decarbonise EU building stock by 2050, a vision laid out in the Clean Energy for All Europeans communication (2016), the majority of buildings must be highly energy efficient, meaning they should comply with an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) label A.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this might prove more difficult than expected. <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/typo3/bpie.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/State-of-the-building-stock-briefing_26Ott_v1.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">New research from the BPIE</a> shows that although building performance is constantly improving in the EU, <strong>only after 2010 was the average building was built to an efficient standard</strong> (0.49 W/m2 K for the building envelope) in the European Union. That means <strong>only 3% of building stock in the EU does actually qualifies for the A-label</strong>, so 97% (not 75% as typically stated) should therefore be upgraded. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Two Steps to Energy Efficiency: A Double Bind? &nbsp;</h3>
<p>“Retrofitting is expensive, and what we find is that <strong>many businesses cannot even get past the first stage of obtaining internal buy-in</strong> to make the initial investment in an energy audit, never mind actually getting to the second stage of installing the more efficient equipment or retrofit that will help them reach EPC level A,” explains Daniel Utges, Product Director at DEXMA, an energy analytics firm based in Barcelona. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://get.dexmatech.com/energy-innovation-survey-report"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">conducting a survey of nearly 300 energy professionals</a> last year (report download is free but requires registration), DEXMA found that most of them struggle equally with <strong>understanding which sites to focus on first</strong>, and obtaining the budget to install the hardware required to save energy. “Those pain points were like alarm bells for us from a product development perspective,” remarks Daniel. He and his team understood that they needed to build something that would help users identify savings opportunities quickly and easily, removing the friction or barriers that typically puts the brakes on most energy efficiency projects. &nbsp;</p>
<p>""In addition to a retracted starting line, a <strong>serious lack of data granularity</strong> prevents us from being able to pinpoint exactly which buildings should be retrofitted and when, especially when a portfolio of multiple buildings is involved"", says Daniel. For this reason, it was important for DEXMA to find a way to leverage their database of more than 50,000 buildings monitored in real-time - that means 30 million daily readings that can be used to deliver historical context and the deep granularity that is typically missing from building energy data. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet another barrier appears when considering how SMEs are often left out of well-intentioned government initiatives to promote energy efficiency. “In talking to our partners and their clients, we also noticed that subsidies and support programs tend to be aimed at very large energy consumers, such as manufacturing facilities or energy producers, or on the other end of the spectrum, towards residential energy-saving initiatives,” remarks Daniel. The UK’s Clean Growth Strategy offers a telling example, with the only mention of SMEs appearing in a commitment to explore “how we can improve the provision of information and advice” to encourage their uptake of energy efficiency technologies.” &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fortunately, new data-driven tools are becoming available to address this set of building energy performance challenges and needs. </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“SMEs are really the missing middle when it comes to energy efficiency,” says Daniel. “We quickly realised there is a real need, especially for businesses with high energy savings potential but without the resources to outsource an ESCO to find and leverage them. That’s why we designed a platform for businesses who want to save energy through efficiency, but don’t necessarily have the time, resources or expertise to start.” &nbsp;</p>
<h3>EnergyGrader: A Smarter Step to Accelerated Building Energy Performance &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Using energy bill data as its main input, EnergyGrader is a new platform that helps building operators, owners, facility managers, and even business managers with little to no background in energy efficiency to pinpoint real energy savings opportunities with unprecedented ease and speed. Users can compare personalised energy savings recommendations, according to payback period and ROI, in order to catalyse the process of finding a specific solution that fits their needs and budget.</p>
<p>Even though business managers might be able to visualise their usage on their energy bill, they often don’t take action because they don’t understand the effects of various actions might have on their budget, or perceive energy efficiency interventions as too complex or disruptive. EnergyGrader takes the friction out of energy-efficiency decisions by linking them to real consumption data, and putting them in context for each and every user. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The availability of <strong>customised recommendations based on real energy spend data</strong> can also provide the necessary justification and impetus to encourage businesses to actually implement energy efficiency projects. “For owners with larger building portfolios, the opportunity to scale projects is huge and much more cost effective,” says Daniel. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>AI platform powered by pattern recognition algorithms</strong> can recommend several different solutions automatically, including:</p>
<ul> 	<li>which retrofit technology works best for your project and budget</li> 	<li>insights into energy efficiency project CAPEX or OPEX</li> 	<li>when to expect savings</li> 	<li>which buildings or sites offer the highest savings potential</li> 	<li>payback periods and other specific, CFO-friendly metrics &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p>""EnergyGrader’s recommendation library will continue to expand and provide increasingly precise recommendations over time, as it learns from users’ energy spending behaviour and building profiles. The idea is to grow the platform’s recommendation capabilities in terms of accuracy and availability. It is really exciting to be at the forefront of introducing artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to the building sector, where it can have a significant impact"", says Daniel. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On Thursday, 9 November 2017, <strong>DEXMA Product Director Daniel Utges</strong> will be hosting a<strong> free webinar</strong> on <strong>how to scale energy efficiency with AI</strong>. Following the 9th of November you can use the registration link (below) to view the recording.</p>

<p>The <em>Investor Confidence Project</em>, funded by the European Commission, was brought to Europe to develop a system to give confidence to all active stakeholders. There are still concerns that investing in energy efficiency is risky. ICP Europe is designed to change that. Starting with investments in buildings, ICP Europe has now broadened the scope to include industry, district energy and street lighting. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Importantly, ICP Europe will soon convene a Technical Forum for street lighting, following one for industry (that is now in its final stages before the Protocol is published in December). ICP Europe is now looking for more experts to join this Technical Forum.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding the importance of the protocols &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Experts play a valuable role in developing new Protocols for industry, district energy and street lighting. The Protocols define a standardised road map of best practices for originating energy savings following the ICP Project Lifecycle.&nbsp; ICP Protocols are a best practice assembly of existing standards, practices, and documentation in order to create the data necessary to enable underwriting or managing of energy performance risk. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These protocols reference international, European and national standards and best practices to provide all market actors across the European energy efficiency development and investment community with tools to improve the predictability of energy savings and related bankability of energy efficiency projects. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>ICP Europe will soon be working with the European Technical Forum to develop a protocol for street lighting projects found in the European market. &nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>How the ICP process works </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of the Investor Confidence Project is simple to understand. The protocols set out requirements for an investment package to be submitted by a project developer that covers critical stages throughout the project lifecycle. This documentation is subsequently reviewed and validated by a third party Quality Assurance Provider. Compliant projects are awarded the Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ certification. This process enables standardised project performance underwriting, leading to better data on performance, and a more efficient marketplace with less duplicative engineering and lower transaction costs.&nbsp; The result should be an increase in deal flow and a more transparent and efficient market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, a potential street lighting project is identified. Someone has to do the necessary calculations to determine the viability. Someone has to be identified to install it (often the same organisation). And some organisation needs to fund it. What this project does is standardise the procedures so that all players gain confidence in the system. &nbsp;All stakeholders (owners, project developers and investors) gain from this. There is third party monitoring to ensure everything is done correctly. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The technical integrity of the protocol </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the protocol is not credible and technically worthy, then the entire ICP concept fails. For that reason, it is important to have a strong body providing technical guidance.&nbsp; On the ICP team, the people writing the draft protocols have years of experience and are technically sound.

<p><strong>“For that reason, ICP Europe needs technical experts who understand the European context in those areas.” &nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each defined protocol creates a standard set of documentation that will help standardise project performance underwriting, leading to better data on performance, and a more efficient marketplace with less duplicative engineering and lower transaction costs.&nbsp; The result should be an increase in deal flow and a more transparent and efficient market.</p>

1119,"Energy Flexibility Initiative from the University of Stuttgart",NULL,NULL,"<p>At this Autumn’s session of the UNECE group of Experts on Energy Efficiency in Geneva, the groups’ Vice-Chair and Energy Efficiency in Production, University of Stuttgart (EEP) Head of International Affairs and Strategy Stefan M. Buettner elaborated to the representatives of member countries of the United Nations Regional Commission for Europe (UNECE), businesses and NGOs present, the need to incorporate flexibilization of the energy demand into the energy transition equation.</p>
<p>“With the increasing volatility of supply due to an increasing share of renewables in the mix it is an impediment to consider measures of energy flexibility alongside the ambitions to increase energy efficiency”, noted Mr Buettner. With support of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, EEP further explores in&nbsp;the SynErgie-Project routes to a synchronized and energy-adaptive production technology for the flexible adjustment of manufacturing processes to a volatile energy supply.</p>
<p>Together with more than 90 partners – 40 from industry – the SynErgie-consortium explores what types of potentials exist in what form, how often and in what sectors. This is to identify flexibility potentials that are technologically feasible, economic and implementable. We at the EEIP are European and Global level supporters.</p>
<p>Mr. Buettner further lines out that “the flexibility potentials within the aluminium industry alone add up to 13,200 MWh – equivalent to 1/3 of Germanys’ total pump storage capacity. According to the Energy Efficiency Barometer of Industry (#EEBarometer), the appetite for flexibility increases with company size and varies a lot across manufacturing sectors.”</p>
<p>Already now, so Buettner “3 out of 4 companies in the automotive sector do already consider energy flexibility of future relevance for their company. Also the demand-sides’ view on energy flexibility and energy efficiency need to be explored better across borders and language which is why we use the opportunity today to launch the&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://ilias3.uni-stuttgart.de/goto_Uni_Stuttgart_svy_1352684.html?lang=en"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">#EE Barometer for companies in the Russian language area</a>.”</p>
<p>Activating the demand side and helping them to overcome barriers to investment into energy efficiency played an essential role in the discussion during which EEPs EEFIG-member Mr. Buettner&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://energyindemand.com/2017/10/28/industry-at-crossroads-reflections-from-recent-eefig-industry-event/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">summarized the outcomes of the latest #EEFIG meeting on industrial energy efficiency</a>&nbsp;that EEP helped to shape. Concluding the two-day meeting of the UNECE group of experts on Energy Efficiency (#UNECE GEEE), the group appreciated that the exchange with EEFIG has been initiated and looks forward to the further implementation of the work plan and the 9&nbsp;<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Forum on Energy for Sustainable Development in 2018.</p>
<p>Tapping into the energy flexibility potentials to make the best out of a changing energy system (#SynErgie), identifying in collaboration with the industrial demand-side what matters (#EEBarometer) and finding solutions to challenges on the technical level (#EEFIG) and in implementation are topics the Institute for Energy Efficiency in Production (EEP).&nbsp;</p>

"
1120,"Raising the priority for industrial energy efficiency",NULL,NULL,"
<p>Energy efficiency policy certainly follows an interesting path, perhaps more so for the industrial sector. Europe has been experimenting with how to unlock the potential of industry so that all European society benefits and improving its energy performance is considered a key. Yet, it has largely left it to the Emissions Trading Scheme that is designed to reduce carbon emission and not necessarily improve energy efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, increasingly more and more realise that <strong>improving efficiency is fundamentally important, in large part for the non-energy benefits</strong>: improved competitiveness, improved products, job creation, leadership in innovation of technologies and so on.</p>
<p>As one colleague, Hans Nilsson, is always willing to point out: <strong>energy efficiency is not difficult but it is complicated!</strong> It is complicated in the policy developments at the EU and national levels. It is complicated within industrial organisations where many within the management structure have different views of the importance of improving efficiency.</p>
<p>There has also been a problem in that there has been far too little discussion on industrial issues at the European level related to policy developments. This is increasingly a problem because the European Commission’s November 2016 “clean energy package” proposal that is now going through the final stages of the approval process was largely devoid of any new initiatives for industry.</p>
<p>All is far from lost. While there are several good initiatives on the ground, I would like to refer to two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only this week, I was fortunate to participate in the abstract selection for next year’s <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.eceee.org/industry/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">eceee&nbsp;industrial efficiency 2018</a> . I am one of the co-chair.&nbsp;Industrial Efficiency 2018&nbsp;offers a mix of formal presentations and informal events as well as great networking. &nbsp;It will be held next June in Berlin. The abstract selection meeting showed a vigour and level of commitment that was most encouraging.&nbsp; And, as a major plus, it became obvious there are going to be some very good papers delivered next year.</p>
<p>Altogether there will be about 100 presentations, many in the form of peer-reviewed papers. The importance of these papers is that they provide needed evidence about what is happening and what should be happening in industrial energy efficiency and the circular economy. They should be a wake up call that there is need for more policy development, more policy analysis and more targeted programmes. It is important that the “evidence” presented gets well known by the EU institutions and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Separately in October, a special and unique event took place in Brussels: industry raised its voice to express the importance of all efforts to promote improvements in their energy performance. Key is in improving the flow of investments. The event was under the <a href=""http://www.eefig.com""><strong>Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG)</strong></a> , established in 2013 by the European Commission Directorate-General for Energy and United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative.</p>
<p>EEFIG provides an open dialogue and work platform for public and private financial institutions, industry representatives and sector experts to identify the barriers to the long-term financing for energy efficiency and propose policy and market solutions to them.&nbsp; While EEFIG covers both the buildings and industry sectors there was a growing concern amongst industry representatives that it was not able to adequately air its views.</p>
<p>In the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/articles/detailed/ff284a1de13cddc93dd350c27d9fd84e/industry-at-crossroads-reflections-from-eefig-industry-event/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">October roundtable, more than 70 participants</a> discussed two themes:</p>
<p><strong>The first theme</strong>&nbsp;on recent trends in financing industrial energy efficiency, challenges and solutions to Them looked at efforts to de-risk investment and there were many good examples provided. It also considered how to get industry to consider investments in industry efficiency as strategic investments as they do for many of their other investments that increase production.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The second theme</strong>&nbsp;– was on moving forward – how to further improve the industrial energy efficiency, and make It more accessible to SMEs. The 2012 EU Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) provided many measures to encourage industrial energy efficiency: mandatory audits for large industry, promotion of energy management systems and supporting SMEs. Now, it is a matter of how to ensure cost-effective measures are identified and implemented. Also it is important to know what can be done to encourage private investment in industrial measures and to have some understanding of what the impact was of the mandatory audits under the EED. The discussion was robust and it highlighted that it is important for focused discussions on aspects of industrial energy efficiency.</p>
<p>This is less common in Brussels than it should be. There was a very good discussion about the need for transparency:&nbsp; amongst companies to share experience in improving efficiency as well as within companies between management and the technical teams. Importantly, the energy efficiency networks well known in countries such as Switzerland, Germany and Sweden were shown as an important approach for improving transparency.</p>
<p>While there were other themes discussed, importantly, everyone learned something. There were many examples of financial instruments or experience at the factory level that surprised most of us since these were new revelations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Final comment</em></p>




<p>Remember those words above:</p>
<p>everyone learned something. &nbsp;Both the eceee industry event and the EEFIG</p>
<p>event highlight the need for more discussion, more evidence of best practice,</p>
<p>good practice and, sometimes, some mistakes. Industry has an important role in</p>
<p>helping Europe meet its Paris climate agreements through improved energy</p>
<p>performance. It is also important that policymakers appreciate the full range</p>
<p>of benefits to our economies from improving industry’s performance. But to make</p>
<p>it work, there is a role for policy. There is a role for significantly more</p>
<p>initiatives. The signs are increasingly more encouraging. Yes, improving energy</p>
<p>efficiency is not difficult but it is complicated. And it is quite fascinating.</p>

"
1121,"Increasing the flow of investment into energy efficiency in industry",NULL,NULL,"<p>The most recent EEFIG meeting focused on industry, a sector that is sometimes neglected compared to buildings.&nbsp; I summarised the work on the EEFIG Underwriting Toolkit and took the opportunity to give a few remarks on how to increase the flow of investment into energy efficiency in industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When talking about energy efficiency investment we often assume we are talking about third party, external investment from banks or funds but the reality is that most efficiency investment is internally funded.&nbsp; The EEVS survey in the UK shows that over 5 years only 5% of projects were financed by third party finance. The IEA energy efficiency report shows that global energy efficiency investment in 2016 grew 16% to $231 billion but in the business sector only 25% of that was provided by debt, and the ESCO market is only 12% of the total investment. The reality is that most of the time the investor is the CFO, in fact even if projects are externally financed the CFO will always be a key decision maker.&nbsp; <strong>CFOs have exactly the same issues around energy efficiency that external investors have, namely: </strong></p>
<ol> 	<li>lack of expertise;</li> 	<li>lack of certainty around the results.&nbsp;</li> </ol>
<p>Given the importance of CFOs and the fact that that have the same issues as third party investors the EEFIG Underwriting Toolkit should be useful for them.&nbsp; EEFIG should consider how best to distribute it to the CFO community, possibly through accounting institutes such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales and similar organisations in member states, and not forgetting CFOs in the public sector who often have their own institutes and networks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Although people often criticise the fact that industry typically insists on a two year payback period for energy efficiency the reality is that it can be entirely rational to do this given:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul> 	<li>uncertainty in outcomes;</li> 	<li>uncertainty about future demand / production levels / product types / markets or even production locations;</li> 	<li>the existence of more strategic investments such as new production plant, new products or marketing.&nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p>The excellent work of <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/articles/detailed/0644cdbcd749103683c1f8d9d88e3fa9/strategic-investing-in-industrial-energy-efficiency-is-a-major-decision/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Catherine Cooremans highlighted that energy efficiency is not usually strategic</a>. In any organisation things that are considered strategic are much more likely to be invested in and usually have longer payback periods.&nbsp;In recent years we have recognised that energy efficiency brings many other benefits than just energy and energy cost savings.&nbsp; These benefits can include</p>
<ul> 	<li>increased asset value,</li> 	<li>increased productivity,</li> 	<li>increased health and welfare and many others.</li> </ul>
<p>These types of benefits are often much more strategic and interesting to decision makers than just energy cost savings. (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/articles/detailed/219bd012d74c75756eb8340db1aa8b40/5-steps-for-a-robust-energy-strategy/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">more about energy strategy here</a>) These benefits have long been neglected in building business cases because the energy efficiency industry focuses just on energy savings – invest x and save y. We have standardised and mandated energy audits but they of course just focus on energy, the standards were developed by energy efficiency experts.&nbsp; We need to work to improve the quality of business cases and ensure they include all the benefits. We now have <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window""><strong>standardisation in the technical aspects of energy efficiency projects, in the form of the Investor Confidence Project and its Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™&nbsp;project certification system</strong></a>, and an approach to <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.unepfi.org/publications/climate-change-publications/eefig-underwriting-toolkit-value-and-risk-appraisal-for-energy-efficiency-financing/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window""><strong>value and risk appraisal in the form of the EEFIG Underwriting Toolkit</strong></a>.&nbsp; The next piece of the jigsaw is a common approach to building better business cases from beginning to end, that means from idea generation right through to commissioning and Measurement &amp; Verification plans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another aspect in industry is the fact that the idea of outsourced energy services has not generally been accepted in industry whereas outsourcing IT or vehicle fleets is accepted. Where it is present it is usually confined to ancillary services like boilers and compressed air systems. We need to encourage knowledge about the benefits to outsourcing energy services and the know-how to implement such projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reality for most industrial companies is that if they have a need for external finance they are most likely to approach their own relationship bank rather than a separate entity such as a specialised energy efficiency fund.&nbsp; We need to work to ensure that the banks that service the industrial sector see the benefits for them which are risk reduction and a new business opportunity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally when we talk about energy efficiency investments we tend to focus on retrofit projects but every day hundreds or even thousands of investment decisions on new production lines, expansion, new production facilities are taken. These are what I call “normal” investments.&nbsp; New plant will inherently be more efficient than older technologies and facilities they replace because of tightened regulations and improved technology.&nbsp; We know however that for many reasons, lack of know-how, time pressure etc., many cost-effective investment opportunities to maximize energy efficiency are missed.&nbsp; To address this we definitely need to build capacity in end-users and consultants around high efficiency design techniques such as integrated design.&nbsp; Proper use of integrated design has been shown by Rocky Mountain Institute and the excellent Sustainable Energy Agency’s Energy Efficiency Design programme to significantly reduce energy costs and capex as well.&nbsp; We also need to help banks ask the right questions by adopting processes like EBRDs, and like ING have implemented for real estate, in which customers asking for finance for new facilities are asked about energy efficiency levels. If banks are to contribute to climate goals they should only be funding improvements and new facilities that move beyond “Business As Usual” improvements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To summarise; to increase the flow of investment into energy efficiency we need to:&nbsp;</p>

<ul> 	<li><strong>build capacity within CFOs</strong> as well as banks to help them better understand and evaluate the value and risks of energy efficiency projects - <em>to do this governments and the EU can promote the use of the EEFIG Underwriting Toolkit within financial institutions and corporate board rooms.</em></li> 	<li><strong>build the case for outsourced energy services</strong> to make them as common as outsourced IT or vehicle fleets - <em>trade associations and providers need to build and promote the case for energy outsourcing. Governments and the EU can help in this.</em></li> 	<li>work to improve the building of <strong>better business cases</strong> through guides and training emphasising strategic non-energy benefits - <em>the EU could support the development of a guide to building better business cases. This will build upon the work that the EU has already supported to roll out the Investor Confidence Project and the EEFIG Underwriting Toolkit.</em></li> 	<li><strong>drive the standardisation</strong> of the development and documentation of energy efficiency projects through best practices and certification programmes such as the Investor Confidence Project’s Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ - <em>development banks and other funders, including providers of grant funding for energy efficiency such as the EU and member state governments, should insist upon using best practices and certification programmes.</em></li> 	<li><strong>demand that all projects have Measurement and Verification (M&amp;V)</strong> and that real performance data is collected and analysed. Over time this will create the data for proper risk assessment - <em>again, all development banks and grant funding should insist on M&amp;V. We can no longer implement projects that don’t generate performance data;even now many projects are being funded without insisting on M&amp;V, even projects that are supported by the EIB and by European grant funds. This is no longer acceptable.</em></li> 	<li><strong>improve capacity around integrated, high efficiency demand</strong>, both amongst customers and consultants as well as the financial community - <em>using “off the shelf”, BAU designs for new facilities and buildings should no longer be acceptable.</em></li> 	<li><strong>equip mainstream financial institutions to ask the right questions</strong> around requests to fund new facilities in order to maximise the uptake of cost-effective energy efficiency opportunities that are often missed today.</li> </ul>

1122,"The technical potential of large and industrial heat pumps",NULL,NULL,"
<p>Heat pumps are considered large if they exceed capacities of 100kW. They can easily reach the one to several megawatt range with the largest units providing 35MW in a single machine. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Currently available heat pump technology</strong> can provide heat up to 100°C with a spread between source and sink temperature of approx. 50 K per stage. <strong>Using heat pumps for applications above 100°C is still a challenge</strong>. While the underlying principles are known and prototypes for these temperature levels exist, they are not yet available in standard products. The current level of research and development projects as well as increased interest by new players to engage in the segment of large heat pumps leaves room for optimism. New and improved products are expected in the market.</p>
<p>Without existing solutions for heat pump applications for <strong>temperature levels above 150°C</strong> this segment has not been included in the current potential assessment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With this in mind, available data from Eurostat for was evaluated to determine the potential for the application of heat pumps in industry. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2012 data for EU-28 reveals, that the industry is using 3200 TWh of final energy and has a demand for heat of approx. 2000 TWh. Figure 2 shows the split of this heat demand. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""352"" height=""523"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/bb5993bb0d.png"" width=""853"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p>Figure 2: Distinction of heat demand in industry by sector and temperature range. [1] &nbsp;</p>
<p>This assessment reveals a <strong>practically reachable potential for heat pumps</strong> in the temperature range up to 100°C of 68 TWh, mainly in the chemical, paper, food/tobacco and wood industries (see blue shaded bars in fig. 2). Adding the sectors of hot water and space heating reveals an additional 74 TWh (see orange shaded bars in fig. 2). With technical progress, an additional potential of 32TWh in the temperature range from 100 to 150°C can be made accessible (see darkest blue bar in fig.2). In total, 174 TWh or 8.7% of all heat demand in industry can be provided by heat pumps.<br /> The higher temperature ranges shown in grey in the graph above remain inaccessible for heat pump technology. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The result of this assessment shows the <strong>realistic potential of heat pump applications. The technical potential is much larger, but can often not be fully used due to practical considerations</strong>.<br /> A more refined, model based analysis executed by Wolf and Blesl comes to the conclusion, that the technical potential of heat pump use in industry across the 28 EU member states is 1717 PJ (477 TWh), with only 270 (75 TWh) or 15% of it being accessible if economic and practical considerations are applied. [1] &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus the model based approach leads to a larger technical potential, but to a much lower economic potential. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Main factors influencing the economic perspective of heat pump operations are</p>

<ul> 	<li>Cost of fossil fuels</li> 	<li>Cost of electricity</li> 	<li>Interest rate</li> 	<li>Efficiency of the heat pump system</li> 	<li>Simultaneous availability of heat supply and heat demand, simultaneous demand for heating and cooling</li> 	<li>Investment cost differences. &nbsp;</li> </ul>

<p>Operation cost savings from heat pump use are possible, if the relative cost of fossil fuels and electricity are smaller than the efficiency of the heat pump system. With a rather distorted energy price, this is more and more difficult, as many governments recover the cost of greening the electric system via electricity cost itself. At the same time the price for fossil fuels does not reflect the negative environmental impact of its use. Thus relative cost of heat provision points in favour of fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Figure 3: Industrial heat pump potential in EU-28 [2] &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since there is a direct relation between energy demand reduction and CO2 emissions, extending the economic potential of demand reduction will also reduce CO2 emissions from the industrial sector. The study concludes a total CO2 emission reduction potential of 86,2 Mt with 21,5 Mt (25%) of it economically viable. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Obstacles, challenges and opportunities</h3>
<p>Main obstacles limiting the use of heat pump in industry are as follows: &nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li>Extreme requirements on a return of investment, often not more than 2 years are accepted. This is further complicated by a comparatively low price for fossil energy.</li> 	<li>Risk aversion, in particular vs. heat pumps which are not trusted, but perceived as a new, unproven technology.</li> 	<li>Limited or no availability of best practise examples that could create trust in new solutions.</li> 	<li>Structural barriers in the industry like high transaction cost for the conversion of processes, as many old processes are based on steam or the need to integrate competences and responsibilities to realise a systems perspective in order to energetically optimise industrial processes and commercial applications &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Both the energy savings and CO2 abatement potential of heat pumps in industrial applications is still largely unused</strong>. Creating more favourable political framework conditions will allow to reverse this trend. These include</p>
<ul> 	<li>Adding a price signal to the use of fossil fuel</li> 	<li>Reduce the burden from tax and levys on increasingly clean electricity</li> 	<li>Provide low interest rates and loan guarantees to energy efficient investments using low carbon emission technologies such as heat pumps</li> 	<li>Increase research and development on standardized heat pump solutions for the identified industrial sectors</li> 	<li>Provide more best practise examples. &nbsp;</li> </ul>

<p>There is a joint effort necessary from policy makers and industry alike to develop the technical and economic potential of heat pump applications in industry. It needs both to pull on the same string (and in the same direction) to fully unleash the potential. &nbsp;</p>

1123,"6 principles for a market design that enables the energy transition",NULL,NULL,"<p><strong>Does the classical business model of utilities have a future in Europe given the transition towards a decentralized energy system?</strong> This was the key question discussed by different economists at the Université Paris-Dauphine on invitation by Prof. Keppler. Among the experts were very renowned economists like Prof. David Newbery from the University of Cambridge, Prof. Glachant from the Florence School of Regulation and Prof. Haucap, the former head of the monopoly commission in Germany. The experts in the panel (presentations can be accessed&nbsp;here) stressed how the economic environment for energy utilities is changing in Europe and the US. In this post, we want to focus on one specific aspect that was raised by Prof. Newbery from Cambridge University in his presentation:</p>
<ul> 	<li><strong>What are the basic principles for a good market design that facilitates decentralization, decarbonization and digitalization? </strong></li> </ul>
<p>The whole presentation by Prof. Newbery can be accessed&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.ceem-dauphine.org/agenda/en/a9b8e79a6a70ea953a557105e944367005669183"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a>. The following analysis is based on a working paper Prof. Newbery has recently published with his colleagues (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1711-Text.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Newbery et al., 2017</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The six principles for an efficient and future proof market design</h3>

<p>In his presentation in Paris, Prof. Newbery summarized six key principles that can be used to define an efficient market design. This summary is illustrated in figure 1 below.</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""355"" height=""493"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/819db0239d.png"" width=""768"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>
<p>Figure 1: Six principles for market and tariff design,&nbsp;Newbery (2017)</p>
<p>Basically, these principles serve as an orientation for policy makers on how to get closer to the ideal market design for the energy sector.&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1711-Text.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Newbery et al. (2017)</a>&nbsp;provide a nice and comprehensive definition of the ideal market design:</p>

<ul> 	<li><strong>Time</strong>: electricity prices are determined at a very granular temporal level, e.g., second by second, now and for trade in the future, up to 10-30 years hence;</li> 	<li><strong>Space</strong>: prices vary at a granular spatial level – perhaps at each connection point in the network, reflecting how demand or costs differ across locations;</li> 	<li><strong>Carbon and other emissions</strong>: climate and air pollutant damages are priced at their social cost and thus incorporated into decision-making by companies. (Newbery et al, 2017)</li> </ul>
<p>In the following, we will dive deeper into each of these principles to develop a better understanding of the fundamental arguments and implications behind each principle.</p>
<h3>Principles 1 and 2: Correct market failures close to source and allow for appropriate cross-country variation in market design across MSs rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.</h3>
<p>We discuss these two principles together as they are linked very closely. Basically, the idea behind these two principles, as they are defined by&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1711-Text.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Newbery et al (2017)</a>, is that the definition of market rules should be a task for member states in the EU to secure that the national market design addresses the specific market failures in each member state. Importantly, this implies that market design should be harmonized in Europe. Rather, the general set of rules should be defined in Europe to secure interoperability of markets, but detailed rules to address local problems should be defined by member states.</p>
<p>From our perspective, this principle has an additional implication: While the market design should be specified on the European level with additional adaptations made by the member states, decentralization of generation and provision of flexibility (ancillary services) results in a decentralization of market failures as well: While a centralized energy system may face market failures that occur all over the state independently from the specific location of the market parties, a decentralized energy system is more likely to face market failures that differ between regions in the member state (e.g. the coordination between generations and the networks as we have discussed in this&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.enerquire.com/blog/coordination-in-smart-grids-the-key-challenge-for-the-dso"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">post</a>&nbsp;might not result in inefficiencies (i.e. market failures) in all parts of the member state, but in some specific regions). Therefore, the market design on the member state level should be capable to address regional market failures as well, meaning that the national market design allows for regional adaptations, as long as this does not reduce interoperability within the overall system (national and between the member states). Regional flexibility markets, as we have discussed in this&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.enerquire.com/blog/uzsa870ypystg7nxzv3n8kkld0ljas"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">post for the EU</a>&nbsp;and this&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.enerquire.com/blog/regional-flexibility-market-the-german-perspective"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">post for Germany</a>, can serve as one example for such a regional differentiation of the market design.</p>
<h3>Principle 3: Use price signals and regulated network tariffs to reflect the value of all electricity services and deliver the least system cost solution.</h3>
<p>We have discussed earlier here on enerquire that prices should be used to coordinate the network with the market based parts of the electricity supply chain, generation and retail (for details see&nbsp;this <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.enerquire.com/blog/coordination-in-smart-grids-the-key-challenge-for-the-dso"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">post</a>). Importantly, prices cannot only differ between customer groups and in time (e.g. day and night tariffs), but can have a locational component as well. This is of particular importance in systems with increasing shares of distributed renewable generation that is connected to the low voltage distribution grids. Basically,&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1711-Text.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Newbery et al (2017)</a>&nbsp;state correctly that prices provide a signal to the market parties to compare the value of all electricity services in a market. For the coordination of generation and network management this has two dimensions as noted by&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1711-Text.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Newberry et al (2017)</a>:</p>
<ul> 	<li><strong>long-run</strong>: prices should secure that generation (especially from intermitted renewables) are located at the right spot within the network to reduce overall system costs (i.e. generators should be located in that area of network where the new generator incurs the least costs for the network)</li> 	<li><strong>short-run</strong>: prices should secure that each resource that is connected to the network is dispatched efficiently</li> </ul>
<p>From our point of view one of the most significant shortcomings of the existing market design in Germany is actually the quite poor fulfilment of principle 3, which puts the following question at the heart of the current debate in Germany: How do we develop a market design that uses price signals to efficiently operate the system in the short- and in the long-run? It seems clear that we need more flexible prices that reflect the current balance between generation and consumption; we further need these prices to include information about the system costs of the network connection. Different approaches could be used to reach efficient price signals that allow a differentiation in time and location. Today, though, in most energy systems, the basic energy tariff is a uniform price for energy and network usage. Network usage is paid for by a postage-stamp fee that is calculated per voltage level and thereby the total network costs (including costs for congestion management and balancing) are socialized via a system of network charges. Theoretically, network costs could be covered by generation and load (demand), but today most if not all energy systems rely on a system where the load covers the costs of the networks and generators use the networks free of charge. Though there exist some energy systems where flexible tariffs are already offered to the consumers today, uniform pricing is still the rule and locational differentiation in consumer prices is only applied in very few energy systems today. If you are interested to learn more about different schemes for flexible prices we can recommend a paper written by our colleagues who discuss the pros and cons of different flexible tariff scheme for systems with high shares of renewables (available here) (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957178711000373?_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_docanchor=&amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Brunekreeft et al. 2011</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Principle 4: Collect the difference between the regulated allowed revenue and efficient prices in the least distortionary way from final consumers.</h3>
<p>This principle specifies how the cost recovery for network costs should be distributed among generators and consumers.&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1711-Text.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Newbery et al (2017)</a>&nbsp;stress that finance principles tell us that costs should be recovered from the beneficiaries of the system, namely the consumers. Though in general we agree with this approach, the question needs to be raised whether the complexity of distributed systems requires an adaptation of this cost recovery approach that solely focuses on the consumers. This seems to be especially true in systems where single grid connections fulfil both functions, consumptions and production, e.g. when private households feed electricity (e.g. from solar PV) into the networks at certain times in the course of a day. To us, the notion in the principle, that final consumers should pay the bill for the networks might be true for traditional centralized energy systems, but does it still hold for distributed systems? If not, what are the alternatives and what are the pros and cons of these approaches? Again, you can find more about this discussion in a paper by&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957178711000373?_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_docanchor=&amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Brunekreeft et al (2011)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Principle 5: Efficiently “de-risk” the financing of low-carbon investment as the electricity system becomes more capital-intensive.</h3>
<p>A general challenge for renewable-based energy systems are the high capital costs required by this system. Though in the long-run the total costs of a renewable-based energy system are likely to be lower than a fossil-based system (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.agora-energiewende.de/fileadmin/Projekte/2016/Stromwelten_2050/Gesamtkosten_Stromwelten_2050_WEB.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">AgoraEnergiewende, 2017&nbsp;english summary p.7</a>), the upfront costs are very high. Compared to conventional generation, which - from an investor’s perspective - gains from higher shares of fixed and flexible operation costs (as these costs are discounted in the investment calculation), renewables face a higher investment risk, as most costs are not discounted in the calculations. More information on the differences in risks between conventional and renewable generation can be found in the paper by&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.neon-energie.de/Hirth-Steckel-2016-Capital-Costs.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Hirth &amp; Steckel (2016)</a>. Due to the higher capital intensity of investments in renewable generators, the risk for the individual plant operator can be (too) high. Therefore,&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1711-Text.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Newbery et al (2017)</a>&nbsp;stress the importance of risk-sharing among the beneficiaries of a renewable-based energy system, which again are (or at least should be) the consumers. Basically, principle 5 suggests that consumers should carry some of the risk of the investment in renewables (as they benefit from it e.g. via reduced CO2-emissions, climate mitigation). As the risk then is shared among a large number of people, the individual risk is rather low compared to the individual risk each plant operator has to face. At the same time, plant operators should have the right incentives to manage that risk to secure an efficient market design.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Principle 6: Retain flexibility to respond to new information on the attractiveness of different low-carbon technologies.</h3>
<p>The last principle defined by&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1711-Text.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Newbery et al (2017)</a>&nbsp;is the least concrete, but from our perspective, it points at an imperative for the general approach of an efficient market design for renewable based energy systems: Create a flexible system that allows to adapt to new technologies, data and information available in the future that might unlock new efficiency potentials. Newbery et al (2017) specifically point out that in the future we will gain new insights into the costs and benefits of new technologies and flexibility potentials and that the market design needs to be able to adapt to these new findings within a short period of time. This is a significant point for a new, adaptive and future proof market design: While clean technologies might take a long time before entering the mass market at profitable price levels, data driven business models evolve much faster. This increasing speed of innovation and mass-market adoption can be observed in many markets that have already achieved a higher degree of decentralization than the energy system. But with new technologies like smart metering, distributed ledger technology and artificial intelligence on the rise, digital innovations might dominate the next decade of energy systems as well. Therefore, the market design needs to be able to quickly adapt to new technologies and data driven business models. If you are interested in the question how governance systems (like the market design) can facilitate innovation and provide the necessary flexibility required by distributed and digital energy systems we recommend this paper for details <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268117301403"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">(Buchmann 2017)</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>The energy transition requires a flexibile market design that allows to correct local/regional market failures</h3>
<p>With these six guiding principles for a good market design&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1711-Text.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Newbery et al (2017)</a>&nbsp;provide a basis to further develop an appropriate market design. Based on the inputs by&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1711-Text.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Newbery et al (2017)</a>&nbsp;we identify three guidelines for the market design that are of particular importance for energy systems that develop towards more decentralization and digitalization:</p>
<ol> 	<li>prices should provide a basis to compare all energy services with each other. This includes that prices vary with respect to time, volume, location and provide information about new services (like flexibility) as well</li> 	<li>The market design needs to be able to tackle market failures close to its source. With decentralization, this requires that the market design is capable to address different market failures in different regions (either on the member state level or even within a member state) with different measures to achieve efficient solutions.</li> 	<li>Especially digitalization but also decentralization require that the market design is flexible and capable to adapt fast to new innovations. With an increasing speed of (digital) innovations, a fast responding market design is necessary to achieve efficient markets</li> </ol>

Please find more information about the Technical Forum at the end of this post.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The <em>Investor Confidence Project</em>, funded by the European Commission, was brought to Europe to develop a system to give confidence to all active stakeholders. There are still concerns that investing in energy efficiency is risky. ICP Europe is designed to change that. Starting with investments in buildings, ICP Europe has now broadened the scope to include industry, district energy and street lighting.</p>

<table class=""csc-frame-frame1""> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><strong>Stephen Hibbert, Global Head of Energy &amp; Carbon Efficiency Finance, ING Wholesale Banking:</strong> 'We have supported ICP’s work to standardise project development in the building sector and are pleased to see the project being extended into industry, street lighting and district energy.'</th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p>Importantly, ICP Europe will soon convene a <strong>Technical Forum for district energy</strong>, following one for industry (that is now in its final stages before the Protocol is published in December) and another on street lighting that will convene early 2018. ICP Europe is now looking for more experts to join this Technical Forum for district energy. For the purpose of this project district energy projects are characterised by heating and/or cooling distributed to a group of buildings from a central energy generation plant. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Understanding the importance of the protocols &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Experts play a valuable role in developing new Protocols for industry, district energy and street lighting. The Protocols define a standardised road map of best practices for originating energy savings following the ICP Project Lifecycle.&nbsp; ICP Protocols are a best practice assembly of existing standards, practices, and documentation in order to create the data necessary to enable underwriting or managing of energy performance risk. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These protocols reference international, European and national standards and best practices to provide all market actors across the European energy efficiency development and investment community with tools to improve the predictability of energy savings and related bankability of energy efficiency projects. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ICP Europe will soon be working with the European Technical Forum to develop a protocol for district energy projects found in the European market. &nbsp; </strong></p>
<h3>How the ICP process works &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The <strong>concept</strong> of the Investor Confidence Project is simple to understand. The protocols set out requirements for an investment package to be submitted by a project developer that covers critical stages throughout the project lifecycle. This documentation is subsequently reviewed and validated by a third party Quality Assurance Provider. Compliant projects are awarded the Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ certification. This process enables standardised project performance underwriting, leading to better data on performance, and a more efficient marketplace with less duplicative engineering and lower transaction costs.&nbsp; The result should be an increase in deal flow and a more transparent and efficient market.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>For <strong>example</strong>, a potential district energy project is identified. Someone has to do the necessary calculations to determine the viability. Someone has to be identified to install it (often the same organisation). And some organisation needs to fund it. What this project does is standardise the procedures so that all players gain confidence in the system. All stakeholders (owners, project developers and investors) gain from this. There is third party monitoring to ensure everything is done correctly. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>The technical integrity of the protocol &nbsp;</h3>
<p>If the protocol is not credible and technically worthy, then the entire ICP concept fails. For that reason, it is important to have a strong body providing technical guidance.&nbsp; On the ICP team, the people writing the draft protocols have years of experience and are technically sound. But, we understand that a transparent and open, multi-stakeholder approach to the process, where we try to make sure to collect enough EU representativeness to make sure protocols are applicable in all EU markets, is key to their acceptance and usefulness.&nbsp; For that reason, ICP has always used a group of experts to provide comments and advice. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These protocols reference international, European and national standards and best practices to provide all market actors across the European energy efficiency development and investment community with tools to improve the bankability of relevant energy efficiency projects.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“For that reason, ICP Europe needs technical experts who understand the European context in those areas.” &nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each defined protocol creates a standard set of documentation that will help standardise project performance underwriting, leading to better data on performance, and a more efficient marketplace with less duplicative engineering and lower transaction costs.&nbsp; The result should be an increase in deal flow and a more transparent and efficient market. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Joining the Technical Forum &nbsp; &nbsp;</h3>

1125,"We accelerate the Energy Transition.",NULL,NULL,"<p>The energy transition is already happening today. The fourth liberalisation package is going through the EU codecision process and it introduces exciting new elements for a demand-driven electricity system. The 10 millionth heat pump will be installed next month and we will have a million electric vehicles on Europe’s roads in 2017. Renewables are installed in the tens of GigaWatt and energy management is becoming a standard practice in industry. Energy and climate targets for 2020 will be amply met. And these are just some of the success stories.</p>
<p>But developments are not proceeding fast enough to meet long-term goals. To quote the European Environment Agency, the EU and member states “will have to intensify their efforts considerably to meet longer-term energy and decarbonisation objectives for 2050.” Fortunately, the glass is half full and not half empty, but lately we appear to be slowing down whereas we should be speeding up.</p>
<p>That’s the rationale for #AccelerateET, a social media initiative run by the <a href=""http://www.copperalliance.eu/"">European Copper Institute</a>&nbsp;(ECI),&nbsp;<a href=""http://onepolicyplace.com/"">One Policy Place</a>&nbsp;(OPP) and <a href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/"">Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes</a>&nbsp;(EEIP). Our desire is to amplify the most powerful views and statements from the EU champions of the energy transition. This campaign will start with the State of the Energy Union on November 24 and run until EU Sustainable Energy Week in June 2018.</p>
<p>Through OPP’s exceptional policy monitoring service, we will highlight those champions speaking up for energy transition and a more rapid decarbonisation. We may find them in the EU institutions, member states, academia, research organisations, industry, municipalities or concerned citizens. Our aim to intensify the energy transition conversation on social media. Join us by using <strong><a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=%23AccelerateET&amp;src=typd"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">#AccelerateET</a></strong>.</p>
<p>OPP is a neutral media partner open to different views and this is where ECI comes in. Since copper is used throughout the energy system, from production over transmission and distribution to end-use, ECI has a systemic view on the energy transition, covering the energy and transport systems, and is equally involved in climate and environmental issues. ECI runs programs such as&nbsp;<a href=""https://href.li/?http://www.leonardo-energy.org"">Leonardo ENERGY</a> and&nbsp;<a href=""https://href.li/?http://www.decarbeurope.org"">DecarbEurope</a>&nbsp;that support the energy transition and aim for rapid decarbonisation. ECI will monitor the OPP platform for messages on these topics.</p>
<p>Through its Leonardo ENERGY initiative, ECI reaches a network of 45,000 professionals. Partnering with EEIP, an energy efficiency platform and energy transition communication leader with over 135,000 members, will ensure maximum outreach. The three #AccelerateET partners will reach out to the energy community with messages about the energy transition, leaving no doubt that the energy transition is wanted, necessary, cost effective, technically feasible and has no alternative for the European Union.</p>
<p>EU energy and industry policy already drives the energy transition. For this to continue, concerted action from national and local governments, the private sector and citizens is necessary. And where better to meet than on social media?</p>
<p>Join #AccelerateET, and help us spread the word. We welcome your input on strong, progressive ‘can do’ messages that we might otherwise miss.</p>

1126,"The Italian Energy Audits model: A “cocktail” of best practices that lead to success",NULL,NULL,"<p><em>“With more than 15 000 diagnoses performed by more than 8 000 companies, Italy continues to be at the top among the virtuous countries in the EU to actuate the energy audits in large enterprises and energy consuming companies as required by the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED).”[i]</em></p>
<p>In March this year, I wrote about the how the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/articles/detailed/999325585c33f81f2b421390498a8124/energy-audit-in-smes-could-unlock-great-energy-efficiency-potential-in-europe-a-focus-on-the-italia/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Italian model could unlock the great energy efficiency potential in the country’s SMEs</a>. While energy audits are mandatory for large companies, Italy requires them for certain SMEs as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>New data presented in the Energy Efficiency Annual Report 2017 published by ENEA, the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy, and Sustainable Economic Development, confirms how the energy audits model continues to be successful in Italy. 2016 data reveals that <strong>20% of the total energy audits received were performed by SMEs,</strong> and shows that <strong>potential savings between 0,8 Mtoe and 1,1 Mtoe could be achieved with a payback period equal or less then three to five years respectively. &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>What is the secret to this success? We already know that one of the keys is that the Italian model requires SMEs to undergo energy audits in case it is an energy consuming company, and mandatory implementations of the identified measures.</p>
<h3>Let’s first look at some data - Results as of December 2016 &nbsp;</h3>

<p>According to ENEA, a total of 15 154 diagnoses from 8 130 companies were received as of December 2016, increasing by around 8% from the 2015 data.[ii] Among the enterprises obliged to undergo energy audits, around 65% of the diagnoses received were performed by large enterprises, while 30% by energy consuming companies, of which 20% SMEs and 10% large enterprises. About 2% were done by enterprises with ISO 50001, and approximately 3% were done on a voluntary basis by enterprises, municipalities, and consortia. The following figure depicts the percentages of enterprises performing energy audits as described. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""356"" height=""533"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/68dca1ae3f.png"" width=""900"" style="""" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 1 Enterprises performing energy audits (%) by category (Source: data elaboration from ENEA)</em></p>
<p>The diagnoses received showed potential cumulative savings of about 1,5 Mtoe, of which almost 0,8 Mtoe could be achieved with slightly more than 8 000 interventions and a payback period equal or less then three years, while more than 1,1 Mtoe could be achieved with about 14 000 interventions and a payback period equal or less then five years. The following chart illustrates the progressive interventions and potential savings (Mtoe) in relation with payback time (years).[iii] &nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Figure 2 Progressive intervention (numbers) and potential savings (Mtoe) in relation with payback time (years) (Source: data elaboration from ENEA) </em></p>

<h3>A “cocktail” of best practices that lead to success &nbsp;</h3>

<p>The secret of the Italian success is to find in the innovative approach that includes a mix of best practices. The result is a “cocktail” of these best practices that lead to success, where the main ingredients can be identified as <strong>Technical, Financial,</strong> and <strong>Communication &amp; Awareness</strong>. &nbsp;</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""358"" height=""525"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/b2a83dce39.png"" width=""900"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>


<h3>The Technical Ingredient &nbsp;</h3>

<p>Overseen by ENEA, the technical ingredient includes <strong>Permanent Technical Tables, Standardized Accountability Systems</strong>, and <strong>Sectoral Guidelines</strong> along with <strong>Specific Procedure for Multi-Site Companies. &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>ENEA created several Permanent Technical Tables with the interested parties (experts in the sector, stakeholders, ESCo and trade association) to identify effective, efficient and shared solutions, in line with the Legislative Decree 102/2014. The Technical Tables delivered a series of proposals that were adopted by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (MISE) respectively in May and October 2015, and November 2016.[iv] Moreover, this approach increased awareness among enterprises to meet the deadline for the presentation of the documentation. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“During the European Sustainable Energy Week 2017 (EUSEW,) ENEA and the Italian Thermotechnical Committee (CTI) emphasized to the representatives of the European Commission the role of the technical norms as fundamental instruments to reach the targeted objectives.”….“ENEA and CTI are working towards the definition of a European norm on the design of the energy efficiency measurements and monitoring plans.” Antonio Panvini, General Director CTI[v] &nbsp; </em></p>
<p>Along with the Permanent Technical Tables, ENEA proposed and developed an innovative and logical operative approach to articulate the energy audit, and a scheme to analyze the energy structure of the site subject to the audit. The scheme gives a complete overlook of the energy performance of the production site, for every energy carrier (electric, thermal, vapor, hot water, etc.). Below are examples (Italian version) of an Enterprise Energy Structure developed by ENEA. &nbsp;</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""359"" height=""372"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/7e1d6452cc.png"" width=""513"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p><em>Figure 4 Example of enterprise energy structure of a productive site (Source: ENEA)</em></p>
<p>Through the analysis of the diagnoses received ENEA also developed Energy Performance Indexes for each sector[vi] as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul> 	<li>Energy performance index of the plant (toe/t)</li> 	<li>Energy performance index of the plant relative to the electricity consumption (toe/t)&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Energy performance index of the of the plant relative to the natural gas (toe/t) &nbsp;</li> </ul>

<p>Figure 5 shows an example of energy performance index developed for the iron foundry plant.</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""361"" height=""243"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/32dacd1235.png"" width=""671"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p><em>Figure 5 Example of energy performance index for the iron foundry plant (Source: ENEA) </em></p>
<p>Together with several Italian trade associations[vii], ENEA developed specific guidelines for each sector, and available for everyone. The guidelines provided the necessary information to fulfill the obligations of the article 8 of Legislative Decree 102/2014. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Financial Ingredient &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The Italian Government and Regions are working together to financially support the energy audits among SMEs. In particular, the Government with the Decree of 12 May 2015 allocated EUR 15 millions a year until 2020 to co-finance Regions and autonomous Provinces programmes to support the delivery of energy audits or for the adoption of energy management system in compliance with ISO 50001 standard by SMEs that are not obliged under Art.8 of the Legislative Decree 102/2014.[viii] Resources are allocated to the Regions based on a proportional number of SMEs on their respective territory. Regions intend to make available other EUR 15 millions, and the total of these financing should cover 50% of the costs to perform the energy audits. As of 2015 data, six regions made available EUR 11.5 million to SMEs for this purpose.[ix] &nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Communication &amp; Awareness Ingredient &nbsp;</h3>
<p>ENEA carried out “<strong>Italy in Class A</strong>”[x] National campaign to stimulate energy efficiency. This is the first National campaign promoted by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development, in line with Art.13 of the Legislative Decree 102/2014. Objective 1 of the campaign for the year 2017 was to <strong>increase awareness and encourage large enterprises and SMEs to perform energy audits and to use the available incentives to install energy efficient technologies</strong>. Among the numerous initiatives is a dedicated website comprehensive of all the activities promoted during the campaign. Trade associations are also providing support and communication to their members to facilitate and boost energy audits. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Observations to the Italian energy audits model &nbsp;</h3>
<p>These ingredients works well if used together. A proper regulatory framework, along with technical and financial support, not only stimulates companies to excel but also facilitate them to meet their deadlines. Proper communication is key to ensure the delivery of the message and to increase awareness. This cocktail of best practices create a virtuous cycle that benefits the entire industry, as confirmed by the Italian energy audits model. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Next step: Unlocking the energy efficiency potential &nbsp;</h3>
<p>What is the amount of investments needed to unlock the 1,5 Mtoe potential cumulative savings described in the diagnoses? This and more will be covered in my next follow up post, so stay tuned!</p>

1127,"Onward we go – starting the credentialing process for ICP Europe industry projects",NULL,NULL,"<p>The Investor Confidence Project, funded by the European Commission, was brought to Europe to develop a system to give confidence to all active stakeholders. There are still concerns that investing in energy efficiency is risky. <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">ICP Europe</a> is designed to change that. Starting with investments in buildings, ICP Europe has now broadened the scope to include industry (large and small), district energy and street lighting.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, I wrote about the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/articles/detailed/57e9f1ab9bf8eb968ae3d9d8459df290/standards-for-industrial-energy-efficiency-projects-the-importance-of-technical-integrity/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">importance of technical integrity</a> and many readers participated in the technical forum for industry. This group helped prepare two protocols on industry: a complex protocol for projects which consists of either a number of different Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) or fewer but more complex ECMs; and a targeted protocol designed for projects which may consist in multiple instances of one or a few Energy Conservation Measures.&nbsp; The third technical forum was held November 29th and the <strong>Protocols were published</strong> the following week. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the ICP Project Development Specification is being prepared. The PDS provides a clear roadmap for Project Developers to correctly implement each requirement specified in the ICP protocols based on current best practices and available industry resources. It represents the collective project development knowledge of a large team of industry experts and has been designed to allow various stakeholders to develop projects that meet a consistent level of quality and conform to the ICP Protocols. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In early 2018, there will be training for individuals and organisations to gain credentials as a project developer under ICP Europe. &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>The Project Developer Credential designates that a project developer (ESCO, Engineering firm, facility manager, asset owner, etc.) is qualified to develop Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ (IREE) projects that comply with the ICP Energy Performance Protocols.&nbsp; The Project Developer Credential allows asset owners, investors, and program administrators to have confidence that the ICP Protocols will be appropriately applied by qualified professionals to originate quality projects producing consistent returns. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Credential Requirement</h3>
<p>Compliance with the admission requirements will be reviewed on a case by case basis. In order to become a credentialed PD, firms must: &nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li>Retain, either on staff or under contract, an individual who has completed the ICP Project Developer training and either: &nbsp; 	<ul> 		<li>Is a licensed Professional Engineer under a nationally recognised scheme which is relevant to energy in buildings (e.g. Chartered Mechanical Engineer); or</li> 		<li>Has an engineering or science degree, and a nationally or internationally recognised certification, which is relevant to energy in industry - these qualifications will be reviewed on a case by case basis. &nbsp;</li> 	</ul> 	</li> 	<li>Provide evidence of a minimum of 5 years’ relevant project development experience for those individuals attending the training, which spans the entire lifecycle of the ICP process;</li> 	<li>Project Developers must provide a minimum of 3 references from past projects</li> 	<li>Maintain Professional Indemnity / Errors and Omissions insurance or equivalent policy &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> </ul>
<h3>Qualification Revalidation Requirements &nbsp;</h3>
<p>This will be based on a three-year renewal cycle. The PD must either: &nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li>Complete one project development/certification in this period, and thus automatically qualify for renewal; or</li> 	<li>Provide evidence of relevant continued professional development activity (for example, attending conferences, attending courses, producing papers) - these would be validated on a case by case basis. &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<h3>Next steps &nbsp;</h3>

<p>ICP Europe is now looking for potential pilot</p>
<p>projects to test the process. Project developers will be trained and</p>
<p>certified to use the Protocols. ICP Europe will also be moving to the</p>
<p>next phase of developing protocols for <strong>district energy</strong> and <strong>street </strong></p>
<p><strong>lighting</strong>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>An <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ft.com/content/40df2780-e708-11e7-97e2-916d4fbac0da"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">article</a> in Financial Times today looks at easing bank capital rules to spur green investment) outlines the investor hurdles and hesitancies in green investments. From risk assessment, to capital requirements and Basel rules investors are faced what is for them less familiar ground. For the EU this is an opportunity to release tools and mechanisms to narrow the €180bn annual gap needed to remedy climate change.</p>
<p>In an interview, Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President for the Euro and Social Dialogue, also in charge of Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union, told the FT he was “looking positively” at the European Parliament initative to lower capital requirements for banks. Objective is to find an efficient way to “direct investment into new technologies such as electric cars and mortgage loans for energy-efficient homes.” Financial Times notes, ""while Europe’s banking sector has backed introduction of a “green supporting factor” to capital rules, the idea is sensitive for regulators, which use bank capital requirements to ensure financial institutions do not become overly indebted.”</p>
<p>At the EU, this work is carried by an expert group, and a report on sustainable finance is expected next month. Mr Dombrovskis said that the European Commission needs to “have to define rigorous criteria for what is green, to prevent banks gaming any initiatives. Investments that promote emissions reductions are a priority for this work.”&nbsp;</p>

1129,"Aluminum Industry: 10 Emerging Technologies for Energy-efficiency and GHG Emissions Reduction",NULL,NULL,"
<p>Aluminum production is one of the most energy-intensive industrial processes worldwide. Although about a third of global aluminum production uses electricity from hydropower sources, the increasing use of coal as the primary fuel for electricity for aluminum production in many countries means that aluminum production is still a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) and greenhouse gas&nbsp; emissions. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), <strong>the aluminum industry accounts for about 1% of global GHG emissions&nbsp;</strong>(IEA 2012).</p>
<p><strong>Annual world aluminum demand is expected to increase two- to three-fold by 2050</strong>. The bulk of growth in consumption of aluminum will take place in China, India, the Middle East, and other developing countries, where consumption is expected to nearly quadruple by 2025. To meet this increased demand, production is projected to grow from approximately 51 million tonnes (Mt) of primary aluminum in 2014 to 89-122 Mt in 2050&nbsp;(IEA 2012). This increase in aluminum consumption and production will drive significant growth in the industry’s absolute energy use and GHG emissions.</p>
<p>Studies have documented the potential to save energy by implementing commercially-available energy-efficiency technologies and measures in the aluminum industry worldwide. <strong>However, today, given the projected continuing increase in absolute aluminum production, future reductions (e.g., by 2030 or 2050) in absolute energy use and GHG emissions will require further innovation in this industry.</strong> Innovations will likely include development of different processes and materials for aluminum production or technologies that can economically capture and store the industry’s GHG emissions. The development of these emerging technologies and their deployment in the market will be a key factor in the aluminum industry’s mid- and long-term climate change mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>Many studies from around the world have identified sector-specific and cross- energy-efficiency technologies for the aluminum industry that have already been commercialized. However, information is scarce and scattered regarding emerging or advanced energy-efficiency and low-carbon technologies for the aluminum industry that have not yet been commercialized.</p>
<p>In 2016, Cecilia Springer of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and I wrote a report that consolidated available information on emerging technologies for the aluminum industry with the goal of giving engineers, researchers, investors, aluminum companies, policy makers, and other interested parties easy access to a well-structured database of information on this topic.</p>
<p><strong>Information about&nbsp;10 emerging technologies for the aluminum&nbsp;industry</strong>&nbsp;was covered in the report and was presented using a standard structure for each technology. Table below shows the list of the technologies covered.</p>

1130,"The benefit of compressed air systems becoming smart - a Boge example",NULL,NULL,"<h2><em>The continuous improvement programme – a smart service – considerably improves the efficiency and life cycle of compressed air systems based on continuous Improvements.</em> &nbsp;</h2>
<h3>The origin of the revolution</h3>
<p>Up to now, manufacturers of compressors have reduced the loss of efficiency in a compressor due to wear and tear in operation simply by changing the lubricants and wearing parts. This can only be achieved through regular maintenance carried out by specialists. In the best scenario, the compressor does not deteriorate further. However, what if the compressor had no lubricants and wearing parts at all? If it were to remain consistently effective without maintenance? If we could make it even better? If we were able to introduce new technical developments and even respond to changes in customer requirements? This idea, which is revolutionary in the compressed air industry, is the <strong>BOGE continuous improvement programme (CIP)</strong> and is already a reality today.</p>
<p>But how can this revolution work? Let us take an example of a customer case to demonstrate this.</p>
<h3>Step 1 – the smart product as a basis</h3>
<p>With the BOGE HST product innovation, we have developed a turbo compressor that is streamlined for energy efficiency and to be environmentally friendly. The extremely wear-resistant compression process takes place completely free of oil and ensures top values in all areas. BOGE HST compressors (55-220 kW) stand out with their energy values of a marginal 1.9% when idling, for example, in relation to the overall power uptake. Material wear, and therefore the necessity for changing components, is virtually non-existent. Exchanging the old compressor technology for the BOGE HST, which has been honoured with the OWL innovation prize, is therefore the basis for implementing the CIP. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 2 – the digital twin of the customer situation</h3>

<p>The revolution of industrial service thinking starts here: Due to the ongoing measurement and documentation of all information that is relevant for the running behaviour of the machine, we obtain a precise illustration of the customer situation.</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""363"" height=""479"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/f7bee3fffd.jpg"" width=""720"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p>What previously necessitated extensive diagnosis with special measuring instruments on-site, is now carried out continuously by the BOGE HST itself. With the help of its own software <strong>BOGE airstatus</strong>, all machine data required for energy efficiency are recorded and transmitted digitally. The <strong>BOGE performance report</strong> generated by this, documents the analysis of a variety of running data, such as the capacity of the machine, the energy consumption and motor temperatures. The customer has digital access at all times to the BOGE <strong>performance report</strong> for their own energy management. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Step 3 – revolution due to smart product, smart service and smart factory in harmony</h3>

<p>Based on the <strong>BOGE performance report</strong> our specialists regularly analyse the operating behaviour of the compressed air station. In a standardised process, there is always the question of whether the components used by the customer can be improved by developments that have already occurred, or even the individual development of parts for the customer.</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""364"" height=""498"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/81c6272b5f.jpg"" width=""720"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p>The main criteria here are the improvement of the system energetics and the extension of the modules relevant to the service life. To ensure the economical production of these individualised components alongside this application-related development of parts, <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.boge.com/en/node/14803/1707"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">new high-tech manufacturing was set up specially for the core components</a>. This enabled the high-quality and efficient production of customer-specific components using assistance systems and intelligent production processes</p>

<h3>Step 4: Implementation in practice – risk-free for the customer and simple to handle</h3>

<p>The potential identified was implemented practically in consultation with the customer. The newly developed generation of compressor units was installed for the user. The BOGE HST has been designed with a view to maximum modularity and service-friendly handling. Changing a compressor unit is therefore designed to be quick and straightforward. Not only does it weigh 90% less than compression units on the market but it is also considerably smaller. The effort and duration involved in conversions is therefore drastically reduced. Local expert knowledge is also no longer required for this. With the use of innovative data glasses, conversions can be carried out on-site by staff without special training or even by the customer's employees.</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""365"" height=""485"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/527a04f588.jpg"" width=""720"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p><strong>BOGE smart glasses</strong> enable an expert to be connected here via video transmission, and they are able to give instructions remotely. Alternatively, the support comes from video instructions or relevant documents on a display built into the glasses. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Step 5: The customer can only gain&nbsp;</h3>

<p>After successful commissioning of the now optimised compressed air station, there is a detailed analysis of the actual energy savings for the customer, for: the installation of the the software or hardware updates is free of charge for the user. Only the actual measured savings are shared by BOGE and the customer over a predefined period. The investment risk for the customer is therefore minimal. The steps outlined in measures 2 and 3 are resumed immediately for continuous optimisation, in accordance with the BOGE CIP customer guarantee: maximum efficient operation of the compressed air station across the entire life cycle. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""366"" height=""507"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/304e0cdbf8.jpg"" width=""720"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>With the <strong>BOGE continuous improvement programme</strong> BOGE is setting standards in the exploitation of potential for the hybridisation of market performance, and demonstrates impressively how the change from classic engineering company to customer-centred service provider can be a success. The combination of the highest level of engineering skill and intelligent data analysis smooths the way to the next level of customer focus. With its capacity for transfer to other industries, this smart service can be viewed as a milestone for increasing efficiency and energy saving beyond the compressed air industry too. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

1131,"FAQ - how the ICP process works for industry, district energy and street lighting",NULL,NULL,"<p>The Investor Confidence Project, funded by the European Commission, was brought to Europe to develop a system to give confidence to all active stakeholders. There are still concerns that investing in energy efficiency is risky. <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">ICP Europe</a> is designed to change that. Starting with investments in buildings, ICP Europe has now broadened the scope to include industry (large and small), district energy and street lighting.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h3>How the ICP process works&nbsp; &nbsp;</h3>

<p>The concept of the Investor Confidence Project is simple to understand. The protocols set out requirements for an investment package to be submitted by a project developer which covers critical stages throughout the project lifecycle. This documentation is subsequently reviewed by a third party Quality Assurance Provider. Compliant projects are awarded the Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ certification. This process enables standardised project performance underwriting, leading to better data on performance, and a more efficient marketplace with less duplicative engineering and lower transaction costs. The result should be an increase in deal flow and a more transparent and efficient market.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, a potential project in a factory or a district energy system is identified. Someone has to do the necessary calculations to determine the viability. Someone has to be identified to install it (often the same organisation). And some organisation needs to fund it. What this project does is standardise the procedures so that all players gain confidence in the system. The factory owner is happy. The developer/auditor/installer is happy. The financial institution is happy. There is third party monitoring to ensure everything is done correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Current situation &nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>Industry</strong>: The industry protocols have been prepared and are now being translated. Now the ICP Project Development Specification is being prepared. The PDS provides a clear roadmap for Project Developers to correctly implement each requirement specified in the ICP protocols based on current best practices and available industry resources. It represents the collective project development knowledge of a large team of industry experts and has been designed to allow various stakeholders to develop projects that meet a consistent level of quality and conform to the ICP Protocols. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Probably starting in March or April, there will be training for ICP will offer trainings to firms willing to become familiar with ICP Protocols, in order to be able to use them in IREE projects. Individuals having taken the Project Developer Training can apply to become part of the ICP Project Developer Network. &nbsp;Trainings are expected to start by the end of March.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we are looking for potential pilot projects in order to test the system.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>District energy</strong>: In early January the first technical forum convened and the draft protocol is now being prepared by the ICP technical team. The Protocol is due to be released mid-April. Then training activities will start soon thereafter. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Street lighting</strong>: In early January the first technical forum convened and the draft protocol is now being prepared by the ICP technical team.&nbsp; The Protocol is due to be released mid-March. Then training activities will start soon thereafter. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Introduction to the Process</h3>
<p><strong>1. Could you explain the entire ICP process? &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>The ICP process is designed to increase the confidence levels of clients, project developers and investors about investing in any specific energy efficiency measure or set of measures. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The ICP system has a number of components:</p>
<ul> 	<li>The core of the ICP methodology is the Energy Performance Protocols that define a standardised road map of best practices for developing and documenting energy retrofits.&nbsp; They leverage existing and commonly accepted European and national standards in conjunction with ICP specified procedures, and documentation based on the various stages of a project life-cycle to create standardised projects with reliable returns. &nbsp;</li> 	<li>The ICP Project Development Specification (PDS) brings the many complex details of an energy efficiency project into focus, providing a clear direction to the entire team with regards to requirements, tools, expectations, and quality management. The Project Development Specification provides a clear roadmap for Project Developers to correctly implement each requirement based on current best practices and available resources.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li> 	<li>The ICP Training System&nbsp;combines the use of the ICP Protocols and independent third party verification to create Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ (IREE) projects that provide investors and building owners with a new level of confidence in project engineering, performance and returns.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li> 	<li>The ICP Quality Assurance process implemented by ICP trained and vetted QA Assessors is an integral part of the creation of IREE projects and associated increased confidence by project stakeholders.&nbsp; For a project to become IREE certified it requires verification by ICP Quality Assurance Assessors, who have been vetted by ICP, to ensure that they possess all necessary qualifications and certifications to provide Quality Assurance for a project developed according to the ICP Energy Performance Protocols. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p><strong>2. If an IREE certified project does not live up to expectations, what is my recourse? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The IREE certification confirms that a project has been developed by an ICP Project Developer according to the ICP Protocols and the certification requires an ICP Quality Assurance Assessor to confirm this.&nbsp; ICP requires that an appropriate Measurement and Verification plan and Operations and Maintenance plan have been developed and presented at the time of certification. This means that the project has been developed using best practices but ICP cannot be responsible for actual or expected energy savings, which are influenced by many factors outside the control of ICP.&nbsp; Using ICP ensures you are using best practice but it does not remove the need to carefully select project developers and ensure best practices in on-going Measurement and Verification and Operations and Maintenance are implemented throughout the life of the project. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Is there a minimum investment size to make project viable? </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, there is no minimum size.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Does ICP support any particular energy efficiency technology? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>No.&nbsp; ICP is technology neutral.&nbsp; Projects can be single technology or use multiple technologies. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. How can my project idea become an early adopter project? &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>At the current time, the Investor Confidence Project is looking for early adopter projects in industry, street lighting and district energy that can test the protocols and system. For information, please contact Quitterie de Rivoyre, ICP Project Manager (<a class=""mail"" href=""mailto:Quitterie.derivoyre@eeperformance.org"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Quitterie.derivoyre@eeperformance.org</a>). &nbsp;</p>
<p>ICP Europe, as a project funded by the European Commission, is giving priority to five countries – Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Portugal and the United Kingdom – and we have representatives in these countries who are actively driving the programme by convening interested stakeholders and offering project assistance in the use of our tools and resources.&nbsp; However, we are also interested in pilot projects in other European countries. Do not hesitate to contact us if you think you may have a suitable project. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. What do I get if my project becomes an early adopter project? &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>We can provide technical assistance and work with your own team or any external project developer to ensure that the project becomes certified.&nbsp; Once the project is certified we will, with your agreement, publicise the project to our network and wider stakeholder network.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. How can I be sure that work undertaken through the ICP process will meet all national standards?</strong></p>
<p>The ICP technical team did a review of all best practice standards throughout the EU and internationally and these are built into the Protocols.&nbsp; The Protocols are then reviewed for completeness by experts from the Technical Forum. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8. How do you assure quality through the entire process? &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>The ICP Quality Assurance (QA) process implemented by ICP QA Assessors is an integral part of the creation of IREE projects and associated increased confidence by project stakeholders. The ICP System requires every project to be verified by an ICP Quality Assurance Assessor. The Quality Assurance Assessors have been trained and vetted by ICP, to ensure that they possess all necessary qualifications and certifications to provide Quality Assurance for a project developed according to the ICP Protocols. Perhaps the most important facet of this process is that the ICP QA Assessor must be an independent verifier.&nbsp; This requirement, which eliminates any conflict of interest and ensures objectivity, helps to ensure that IREE-Certified projects are fully ICP compliant. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9. Will financial institutions accept the assurances given through the ICP process? &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the ICP process is to ensure financial institutions are given higher levels of confidence in energy efficiency projects.&nbsp; We have a large and growing network of investors who support the use of ICP.&nbsp; We also have insurance companies providing energy efficiency performance insurance which provide lower insurance rates for ICP projects.&nbsp; Performance insurance is attractive to lenders and investors and can reduce the cost of capital. &nbsp;</p>
<p>ICP Europe’s Investor Network offers investors a means to promote ICP Europe while connecting with project originators and programme partners.&nbsp; It can be a source of finance for project developers. Information on the Investor Network is available here: <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/investors.html#!directory"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">http://europe.eeperformance.org/finding-qualified-deals.html &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </a></p>
<p><strong>10. Will using the ICP process reduce my overall transaction costs? </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of ICP is to reduce transaction costs and speed up investments in energy efficiency. Experience in the concept in the United States for buildings has shown that transaction costs are definitely reduced.&nbsp; This can occur in several ways such as removing the need to hire independent engineers to undertake due diligence.&nbsp; In the case of insurers, the use of ICP can remove the need to pay for an engineering assessment in order to get insurance. However, there cannot be such a guarantee for any individual project. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11. I am a business owner in Italy. Is this programme available in my country? </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ICP Europe, as a project funded by the European Commission, is giving priority to five countries – Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Portugal and the United Kingdom – where we have representatives who are actively driving the programme by convening interested stakeholders and offering project assistance in the use of our tools and resources.&nbsp; However, we are also interested in projects in other European countries and Italy would be most welcome to participate. Do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p><strong>12. This project is currently in the pilot phase.&nbsp; When will it be fully available on the market? </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project continues until May 2019.&nbsp; We are expecting the market roll-out after that. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>13.&nbsp; Where can I find out more about ICP? &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Virtually everything about this project can be found on our website: <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">http://europe.eeperformance.org/&nbsp; </a></p>

<p><strong>14. Who are the different players in the ICP scheme? </strong></p>
<p>For the design and execution of energy efficiency measure using the ICP approach there are important players.&nbsp; First, there is the client, who can be the asset owner or manager of a facility.&nbsp; There is the project developer who works with the asset owner or manager to design and implement the energy efficiency measure(s). There is the investor that can be a bank or financial institution, or even a Financial Director in the case of internal financing from a company owning a project.&nbsp; Finally, there is the Quality Assurance Assessor who independently verifies that the process defined in the ICP Protocol has been followed correctly. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>15. Do you need to involve an ESCO if the goal of ICP is to help owners find investment?</strong></p>
<p>Every project has to have a project developer and this could be an in-house team, external consultant engineers, an equipment vendor or an ESCO.&nbsp; We are neutral on what type of organisation the project developer is, we are only concerned whether the developer has met the ICP standards or not.&nbsp; An IREE project has to be developed by an ICP trained and vetted Project Developer. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>16. Who can initiate a project? &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>The asset owner/manager or a project developer can initiate the project. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>17. What does it mean to have an IREE project? &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>ICP's Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ (IREE™) is an international certification that ensures best practice, the right professionals and third-party validation are used to deliver high-quality projects that you can bank on.&nbsp; To become an IREE project it must be developed by an ICP Project Developer and independently quality assured by an ICP Quality Assurance Assessor. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>18. At what stage of the project is the Certification delivered? </strong></p>
<p>Certification is delivered when the project is fully developed and costed and prior to the investment decision.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>19. Can ICP assist me in finding external financing for a project? </strong></p>
<p>ICP can provide indirect support in finding finance for projects. ICP Project Developers are made aware of the Investor Network and we hold events to ensure Project Developers can network with investors and lenders.&nbsp; Through the network we have successfully connected project developers to investors. Information on the Investor Network is available here: <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/finding-qualified-deals.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">http://europe.eeperformance.org/finding-qualified-deals.html</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>20. How much cheaper is the financing of an IREE-Certified project in comparison to a similar non-IREE certified project? </strong></p>
<p>There is no evidence yet to date that financial institutions will give cheaper financing although in the USA some institutions offer either lower rates or lower transaction fees.&nbsp; However, because of the ICP approach, financial institutions are more confident that the project will be successful and thus are readier to provide needed financing.&nbsp; In addition, a leading insurer will give IREE-Certified projects lower insurance rates for energy efficiency performance insurance. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>21. Can I use ICP Protocols without going through the certification? </strong></p>
<p>The ICP Protocols can be used separately since these are open source documents. However, they are designed to be used as part of a process that is recognised internationally. &nbsp; Understanding the Protocols &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Understanding the Protocols</h3>
<p><strong>22. How do I know the protocol used for IREE process represents best practice? &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>A dedicated Technical Forum is created for each thematic area (industry, district energy and street lighting). The Technical Forum ensures that ICP Europe staff is producing relevant and needed products and services for the European energy efficiency markets.</p>
<p>The Forum does this through: &nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li>Providing insight and feedback on draft products in webinar based Forum meetings and informally;</li> 	<li>Providing local, national and European knowledge on relevant standards, best practices and initiatives that may be relevant to, or interact with, ICP Europe products and tools; and</li> 	<li>Identifying projects and programmes for piloting of ICP Europe products and services.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p>For the Technical Forum for industry, there are approximately 80 members which helps to ensure a broad range of input. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>23.&nbsp; Is there a protocol targeting specific industrial sectors? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>There are two protocols for industry – complex and targeted. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>1. Complex protocol </em></p>
<p>Intended for complex industry energy efficiency projects that include:</p>
<ul> 	<li><strong>Installation of new technology types or capacities, including new utility generation technologies</strong> - for example, major changes to plant configuration requiring controls modifications&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li><strong>Installation of ECMs with variable and/or unpredictable loads</strong> - for example, refrigeration plant &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p><em>2. Targeted protocol </em></p>
<p>Intended for targeted industry energy efficiency projects that include:</p>
<ul> 	<li><strong>Installation of simple, commonly used technologies</strong> - such technologies will usually have consistent and predictable load profiles; for example, lighting retrofits or motor upgrades; projects could include a number of these types of ECMs</li> 	<li><strong>Installation of ECMs which are like-for-like replacements</strong> - for example, direct utility plant replacements for a similar technology type and capacity &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p>There are no specific industrial sectors that are targeted. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>24. How are the protocols developed and why should I trust them? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The core of the ICP methodology are the Energy Performance Protocols that define a standardised road map of best practices for originating energy efficiency measures following the ICP Project Lifecycle. They leverage existing and commonly accepted European and national standards in conjunction with ICP specified procedures and documentation based on the various stages of a project life-cycle to create standardised projects with reliable returns. The Protocols are developed by the ICP technical team, after considerable research into international best practice and experts from many organisations contribute to the development of the protocols through our Technical Forums.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Technical Forum ensures that ICP Europe staff is producing relevant and needed products and services for the European energy efficiency markets. The Forum does this through: &nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li>Providing insight and feedback on draft products in webinar based Forum meetings and informally;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Providing local, national and European knowledge on relevant standards, best practices and initiatives that may be relevant to, or interact with, ICP Europe products and tools; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Identifying projects and programmes for piloting of ICP Europe products and services.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p><strong>25. Are the protocols for industry, district energy and street lighting all developed the same way? </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The approach used to prepare and review the draft protocols for industry, district energy and street lighting is the same for each sector.&nbsp; This builds upon the approach we used to develop protocols for building energy efficiency projects. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>26. Will the process include renewable energy or energy storage?</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>If these technologies are recommended in the audit process, they can definitely be included.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h3>What ICP can do for Industry &nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>27.&nbsp; I recently had an audit of my facility. How can ICP help me implement the recommendations? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A good audit report will provide many recommendations for energy efficiency measures to be implemented in your facility.&nbsp; These range from low cost/no cost measures to more expensive measures, the specific measures will depend on your facility and processes. By having an audit, you have showed an awareness that your facility’s energy performance can be improved but it is not always obvious how much it will cost to undertake these measures. And you may also be concerned whether investing in those measures will actually bring the expected results.&nbsp; A project developer accredited through ICP will be able to take project proposals through to development using the ICP system which will give you greater confidence in the outcomes. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>28.&nbsp; I would like to reduce the energy costs in my business. How can ICP help? &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>ICP is designed to make it easier to invest in energy efficiency measures. By providing a process that minimises risk, the client, project developer an external financier, or an internal CFO, can all feel good about the reduced risk. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>29. I have an engineering firm that provides energy audits and other related services to industrial customers. What are the advantages of joining this ICP process? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The benefits of adopting ICP and promoting the IREE approach for engineering companies undertaking energy audits and developing projects are:&nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li>IREE provides a repeatable process that aids quality control</li> 	<li>It can enable a higher level of project approval by giving clients and funders more confidence in the outcomes</li> 	<li>It increases your ability to connect with finance and insurance without additional cost</li> 	<li>It is a differentiator which can help you win more projects in a competitive market place -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p><strong>30. Is IREE appropriate for SMEs or is it only for large industry? &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>The ICP approach is definitely appropriate for SMEs. It is hoped that ultimately SME projects, because of their size, will be bundled together to seek financing from financial institutions. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>What ICP can do for District Energy &nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>31. What types of projects can be funded for district energy through ICP? &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>District heating and cooling projects will mostly be in cities. District energy projects are characterised by heating and/or cooling distributed to a group of buildings from a central energy generation plant. Projects will not include measures inside the residential or commercial building but elements of the system up to the point of entry.&nbsp; Measures inside the building could be developed using the existing and fully developed IREE system for buildings.</p>
<h3>What ICP can do for Street Lighting &nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>32. What types of street lighting projects can be certified through ICP? </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Street lighting projects are characterised by lamp and/or lighting control improvements in lighting.&nbsp; They can be publicly or privately owned. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>What ICP can do for Project Developers &nbsp; &nbsp;</h3>
<p>33. How much extra-time does a PD need to comply with the ICP Protocols?</p>
<p>There is no exact measurement of how much more time following the ICP methodology requires from a project developer. However, we think this is a non-issue as: if a project developer is already following state of the art practices and standards, complying with ICP should represent a negligible amount of time. On the contrary, if a project is developed in a way that is far from the best practice presented in the ICP Protocol, then project performance is at risk. In this case the cost of not using ICP is much higher than the cost of time needed to use ICP. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In reality, time also always depend on the complexity and level of investment of the projects, but we don't yet have enough data to provide high certainty answers to this. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>34.&nbsp; What is the vetting process for project developers under ICP?</strong></p>
<p>Being part of the ICP Project Developer Network designates that a project developer (ESCO, Engineering firm, facility manager, asset owner, etc.) is qualified to develop Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ (IREE)&nbsp; projects that comply with the ICP Energy Performance Protocols.&nbsp; The ICP Project Developer allows asset owners, investors, and programme administrators to have confidence that the ICP Protocols will be appropriately applied by qualified professionals to originate quality projects producing consistent returns. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Compliance with the admission requirements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. In order to become an ICP PD, firms must:</p>
<ul> 	<li>Retain, either on staff or under contract, an individual who has completed the ICP Project Developer training and either: 	<ul> 		<li>Is a licensed Professional Engineer under a nationally recognised scheme which is relevant to energy in buildings (e.g. Chartered Mechanical Engineer);&nbsp;or</li> 		<li>Has an engineering or science degree, and a nationally or internationally recognised certification, which is relevant to energy in buildings (e.g. CMVP certification, EPBD energy assessor certification) - these qualifications will be reviewed on a case by case basis.</li> 	</ul> 	</li> 	<li>Provide evidence of a minimum of 5 years’ relevant project development experience&nbsp;for those individuals attending the training,&nbsp;which spans the entire lifecycle of the ICP process;</li> 	<li>Project Developers must provide a minimum of 3 references from past projects&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Maintain Professional Indemnity / Errors and Omissions insurance or equivalent policy. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p><strong>35. Is ICP usable throughout Europe? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; The ICP Protocols have been developed to be used in all EU countries plus Norway and Switzerland.&nbsp; They are available in the following languages: English, German, Portuguese and Bulgarian. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Understanding quality assurance &nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>36. What are the advantages of my becoming a Quality Assurance Assessor under ICP? How do I do it?</strong></p>
<p>Becoming a Quality Assurance Assessor under ICP makes you stand out in the market as you will be able to review and certify IREE projects, which will not be the case of your competitors. IREE-Certified projects are high-quality projects that we hope will get better visibility in the market and better financing terms.</p>
<p>Being a Quality Assurance Assessor under ICP gives you access to the network of ICP Project Developers and so to potential clients. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to become a Quality Assurance Assessor, you need to apply through the europe.eeperformance.org website. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>37.&nbsp; What qualifications do you require for quality assurance position? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>QA Assessors will have been approved under the ICP approach. &nbsp;</p>
<p>QA Assessors are required to have verifiable relevant experience of at least three years in performing&nbsp;third-party&nbsp;technical&nbsp;quality assurance reviews. This should include experience reviewing work performed by&nbsp;other firms&nbsp;regarding baseline&nbsp;development, savings calculations, commissioning, operations, maintenance and monitoring, and M&amp;V. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>38. Following training for ICP project developer and quality assurance person, is there an exam for certification? How long can a firm be an ICP Project Developer or ICP Quality Assurance Assessor? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>There is an on-line exam following the Quality Assurance training.&nbsp; Revalidation will be based on a three-year renewal cycle. The PD must either:</p>
<ol> 	<li>Complete one project development/certification in this period, and thus automatically qualify for renewal;&nbsp;or</li> 	<li>Provide evidence of relevant continued professional development activity (for example, attending conferences, attending courses, producing papers) - these would be validated on a case-by-case basis. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li> </ol>

<p><strong>39. Is the ICP Quality Assurance Assessor an individual or the company? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>After an individual has completed the training and has been confirmed as qualified to be an ICP Quality Assurance Assessor (QAA), the company will be part of ICP’s network of ICP Quality Assurance Assessors. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>40. Do you provide trainings especially linked to a project or can you train a larger audience? </strong></p>
<p>The trainings are for project developers and for quality assurance providers. There is the possibility of individualised training for large organisations with early adopter projects. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>41. Who confirms an individual is qualified to be an ICP Quality Assurance Assessor? </strong></p>
<p>The ICP project partner VERCO delivers confirmation upon review of application and provided the individual has taken the Quality Assurance Assessor training. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>42. Who pays for the Certification? </strong></p>
<p>At the current time, the European Commission funds the project and all costs are borne by the project. However, the project does not pay for the time spent by the project developer. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>43. How much do the Quality Assurance Services cost? </strong></p>
<p>There is no cost during the execution of the Horizon 2020 project funded by the European Commission. When the project is rolled out in the market following the completion of the Horizon 2020 project, market conditions will determine what the costs will be.</p>

1132,"Farewell to Traditional Compressor-Based Refrigeration?",NULL,NULL,"
<p><em>From Ozgun Danaci, DNV GL</em></p>
<p>Until recently, the healthcare industry relied on ultra-low temperature (ULT) freezers with compressor-based cascade refrigeration systems. Cascade systems are simply two separate compressor-driven refrigeration cycles in a cascade arrangement that achieves ultra-low temperatures by removing heat from the freezer in two stages.&nbsp;The first cycle removes heat from the freezer cabinet with its evaporator and rejects that heat in the second cycle with its condenser. Since there is a significant temperature difference between the condenser of the first cycle and the evaporator of the second cycle, ultra-low temperatures can be achieved. The second cycle then returns this heat to the atmosphere to complete the refrigeration cycle.</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""370"" height=""356"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/f8de758cf8.png"" width=""500"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p><em>Figure: Compressor Based Cascade Refrigeration System&nbsp;[1]</em></p>
<p>ULT freezers with a compressor-based cascade refrigeration system can use as much energy as a typical U.S. household annually. Cascade systems can emit more than 70 tons of CO2&nbsp;over its lifetime[2], contributing significantly to global warming. Cascade systems use synthetic refrigerants which cause ozone depletion. On top of the environmental drawbacks, these systems require a significant amount of maintenance due to the number of moving parts and start-stop operation of the compressors.</p>
<p>Recently, freezers using a Stirling cooling system were introduced to the market as an alternative to compressor based refrigeration systems for ultra-low temperature applications. These new freezers are compressor-free and utilize a beta type Stirling cooler that is driven by an integral linear motor. The system consists of a piston, which is moved by the linear motor, and a displacer, which is moved by the working fluid (the piston and displacer are not mechanically coupled). The displacer has a hot and a cold side, where compression and expansion occurs during the heat transfer cycle. The cold side of the cooler is connected to a gravity-driven thermosiphon where refrigerant flows down through the tube as liquid, absorbs the heat from the freezer, transitions to vapor, flows up the tube and condenses back to liquid on the cold side of the Stirling cooler. The Stirling cooler piston/displacer assembly moves the heat to the hot side by a refrigerant and then disperses the heat into the atmosphere with a fan.</p>


<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""371"" height=""382"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/f4fc35c59c.png"" width=""500"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p><em>Figure: Stirling Cooling System&nbsp;[3]</em></p>
<p>A Stirling cooling system uses 60% less energy on average than a cascade refrigeration system. Energy and cost savings from replacing a cascade system with a Stirling cooling system can be as high as 75%, depending on the baseline equipment and operating conditions. Stirling coolers can continuously modulate, thus allowing operations between -20oC to -86oC, compared to the -60oC to -86oC operation of cascade systems. As a bonus, these systems can achieve this degree of cooling by using 100% natural refrigerants which can eliminate the need for ozone depleting chemicals. These systems contain only two moving parts (a piston and a displacer), have no valves, and no oil and gas bearings, which also reduces the maintenance costs.</p>
<p>A 2015 My Green Lab Study,&nbsp;<em>Market Assessment of Energy Efficient Opportunities in Laboratories</em>[4]&nbsp;identified that there are 440,000 to 890,000 ULT freezers in the U.S., 58,000 of which are estimated to be in California alone. Based on estimated ULT freezer energy savings, California labs alone could save up to $59 million per year by replacing compressor based ULT freezers with Stirling cooling freezers&nbsp;[3].</p>
<p>A freezer with Stirling cooling system became the industry’s first Energy Star Certified ultra-low temperature freezer, setting the standard. Some utilities and institutions are paying incentives for Stirling cooling freezers to influence the market. The healthcare industry is already benefiting from this technology.</p>
<p>The challenge: Can this technology replace compressor-based refrigeration systems for commercial applications and should utility energy efficiency programs move in this direction?</p>

1133,"Digital Transformation of Energy Utilities – Shifting Gears?",NULL,NULL,"
<p>Since 2014, utilities have been increasing their investment in digital infrastructure. This is the key finding of the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/DigitalizationandEnergy3.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">IEA report “energy and digitalization</a>” which was published in November 2017. This report provides a detailed overview on how digitalization changes energy consumption in transportation, the industry and the residential sector.</p>
<p>To us, the most interesting part of the report is the one focusing on the utilities’ investment in digital infrastructure. The first remarkable conclusion that can be drawn from the IEA’s data is that the utilities’ investment related to digitalization increased by 50% from 2014 till 2016. While utilities committed around 31 $billion to digital infrastructure in 2014, this number rose to 47 $billion in 2016. Primary drivers for this growth are the investments in charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, which grew from 1 $billion in 2014 to 6 $billion in 2016, and the smart meter rollout which resulted in twice as much spending in 2016 than in 2014.</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""372"" height=""180"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/3539e949d5.png"" width=""500"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p><em>Figure 1: Investment in digital electricity infrastructure and software (source:&nbsp;IEA 2017)</em></p>
<p>But besides these two positive developments, the utilities’ investment aiming at digitalization remained rather constant in the other areas, especially in software solutions. Which story do these numbers tell? Is the energy sector addressing digitalization and committing to this by investing in digital solutions? Do utilities push a digital transformation?</p>

<h3>EV chargers and smart meters enable technologies for digital transformation</h3>
<p>Digital transformation, as opposed to digital optimization, strives to develop new revenue streams from products or new business models. Optimization, on the other hand, describes the process of a company applying digital solutions to its existing processes to increase efficiency and revenues from these established products. If you would like to learn more about the difference between digital transformation and optimization we recommend this post by&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.cio.com/article/3211428/digital-transformation/what-is-digital-transformation-a-necessary-disruption.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Clinton Boulton</a>&nbsp;(2017). Both, digital transformation and optimization are important for the energy sector. However, while digital optimization is a good short-term strategy, the long-term strategy must be to find ways to digitally transform the business model of utilities.</p>
<p>The investments of the utilities in EV chargers and smart meter might be a first step towards &nbsp;digital optimization, but they do not per se imply that utilities start a digital transformation. Rather, these technologies are two out of many technologies required to make the energy sector digitally ready. Especially smart meters increase data availability, which is the basis for digitalization. Further enabling technologies are smart transformer stations or other sensors in the networks. However, investments in infrastructure technologies other than EV chargers and smart meters, which are summarized in the category of smart grid infrastructure by the IEA in figure 1, remained rather constant in the period from 2014 to 2016. In 2016, investment in smart metering exceeded the total investment in all other smart grid infrastructure by nearly 20% (2 €billion difference). Besides the networks, utilities focus their investments related to digitalization on the building sector, often referred to as smart home appliances. Here, utilities are investing a constant amount of roughly 10 billion annually (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.cio.com/article/3211428/digital-transformation/what-is-digital-transformation-a-necessary-disruption.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">IEA 2017</a>).</p>
<h3>Software investments remain constant on a low level</h3>
<p>Not surprisingly, investment in software solutions have remained rather low compared to asset-based investments. This is due to the fact that software is less capital-intense than assets. Still, it is remarkable that while data availability should increase significantly due to the increased investment in data-gathering technologies in networks (e.g. smart meter) and buildings (smart home), the utilities are not investing in software solutions to make use of this data. One reason for this might be that the existing solutions that the utilities apply are already capable of handling and analysing this new and huge amount of data. That they are actually using this capability seems very unlikely since big data, machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are not the standard software technology in the energy sector so far.</p>
<h3>From hardware to software – are utilities making this step?</h3>
<p>Data analytics is the key to success in transforming an energy business towards a digital energy business. While most utilities have started to hire data analysts, the adoption rate of state-of-the-art digital technology still lags behind nearly all other sectors. A recent&nbsp;study&nbsp;by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in cooperation with the MITSloan Management review (MIT) provides one nice example that illustrates the gap between utilities and other sectors when it comes to the application of new digital technologies, in this case Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning. BCG interviewed more than 3,000 industry experts, among them experts from the energy industry and technology companies that are developing AI or deep learning solutions. Two observations were made in the survey related to the energy sector:</p>
<ol> 	<li>Current adoption rate of Artificial Intelligence is the lowest in the energy sector.</li> 	<li>Expectations of the future impact of Artificial Intelligence are the lowest in the energy sector</li> </ol>

<p>The following figures from&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.bcg.com/Images/Reshaping%20Business%20with%20Artificial%20Intelligence_tcm9-177882.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">BCG &amp; MIT</a>&nbsp;illustrate these two observations.</p>

<p><em>Figure 2: Expectations for AI adoption across industries: impact on offerings (BCG &amp; MIT 2017)</em></p>
<p>Figure 2 summarizes how many of the surveyed experts think that AI has already today (red) a significant effect on the companies’ offering and the share of experts that think that AI will significantly influence the companies’ offerings in 5 years (blue). As we can see, on average, only 15% of the asked experts believe that AI has a significant influence on today’s offerings in all the analysed sectors. Yet, it is the energy sector (together with the public sector) where the current adoption rate of AI seems to be the lowest, according to the BCG data. Not surprisingly, AI seems to have the highest impact on the offers of the technology and telecommunication sector today and in the future. While AI’s influence of today’s offerings is rather low in all other sectors, the future expectations differ significantly between the sectors. Especially the experts’ expectations for the role of AI in the energy sector alongside the public sector seems to be rather exceptional, in a bad sense. While on average 65% of all experts expect AI to have a significant effect on the future offerings in the evaluated sectors, less than 50% think so in the case of the energy sector.</p>
<p>A similar, but less extreme picture results when the experts were asked the same question, but this time related to the effect of AI on current and future processes in the different sectors, summarized in figure 3.</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""374"" height=""369"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/bf52e24f7f.png"" width=""500"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p><em>Figure 3: Expectations for AI adoption across industries: impact on processes (BCG &amp; MIT 2017)</em></p>
<p>While the interviewed experts see the lowest adoption of AI solutions in processes in the energy sector today, there is a potential that this will change within 5 years. Still, 55% of the experts that participated in the BCG survey think that AI will have a significant influence on processes in the energy sector in 5 years. Here, the energy sector reaches the second lowest score, but is much closer to the average (58%) than in the case of AI’s &nbsp;expected influence on the offerings in the energy sector.</p>
<p>While AI is just one of the advanced digital technologies out there, the survey of BCG provides a nice indication of where the energy sector stands in terms of digitalization beyond investment in digital infrastructure: It is only competing with the public sector for the title of the least innovative market when it comes to AI!</p>

<h3>Potential applications for AI in the energy sector – the low hanging fruits</h3>
<p>Now, there are two options why AI plays such a comparably low role in the energy sector from the experts’ perspective: Either there are less use-cases for AI in the energy sector than in all other sectors. Or, utilities struggle to adopt this new technology. To give a first indicative answer to this question we would like to refer you to a&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://medium.com/wepower/artificial-intelligence-and-the-future-of-energy-105ac6053de4"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">post</a>&nbsp;on Medium by Tadas Jucikas, co-founder and CEO at Genus AI, who provided a worthwhile summary of current projects that apply AI to the energy sector. Here are some of the examples Tadas provided in his&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://medium.com/wepower/artificial-intelligence-and-the-future-of-energy-105ac6053de4"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">post</a>:</p>
<ul> 	<li>Most prominently, Google’s deepmind team achieved a&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ft.com/content/27c8aea0-06a9-11e7-97d1-5e720a26771b"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">cost reduction of 15%</a>&nbsp;in one of Google’s data centres by letting deepmind optimize the energy management system.</li> 	<li>National Grid, the transmission system operator in UK, partners with the deepmind team to apply AI to balance the networks.

Different projects, for&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-31858-5_2"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">example one at Oldenburg University</a>, Germany, currently reached an increase in prediction accuracy for wind power production by 24% compared to the state-of-the-art solution in the market.&nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p>These are just a few examples of different applications of AI in the energy sector. While this list does not provide a basis to judge whether there are more or less use-cases for AI in the energy sector than there are in other sectors like healthcare, financial or public services, it indicates that there are at least some use-cases. Even more, the fact that the deepmind-team is focusing its efforts on the energy sector might give a hint that the energy sector might actually be a very attractive area for the application of AI.</p>
<h3>Energy companies’ digitalization seems to be a hardware business, while the real action happens on the software-side</h3>
<p>The data from the IEA reveals that utilities’ investment in digitalization is hardware-based, focusing on smart meters and EV charging. Investment in software, however, seems to be lagging behind with no increase in budget over the last three years. With respect to new software solutions, like AI, the energy sector currently comes in last compared to other sectors and will do so in the future according to the survey by BCG quoted in this post. Nevertheless, there are currently many solutions based on AI, machine learning or other digital approaches available to the utilities. Which leaves us with the question whether utilities will pick up the challenge to adopt these new technologies like AI and apply them to their core-business?</p>

1134,"India – a global player in energy efficiency",NULL,NULL,"<p>It has been a while since I have had a chance to write a blog because I have been very busy working with our JV partner EESL as well as on other projects.&nbsp; In November I made my first ever visit to India to speak at the INSPIRE event, so it seemed appropriate to write about energy efficiency in India.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First of all when you look at India you have to get used to the big numbers, starting with 1.3 billion people, installed electrical capacity of 331 GW, and economic growth rates of 7 to 8%</strong>.&nbsp; When you project current trends forward you quickly realise that energy efficiency in India is a matter that should concern the whole world.&nbsp; If India gets it right the world has some chance of meeting climate related targets.&nbsp; A clear example of this is air conditioning which is vital in most parts of India, and is a market set to grow dramatically.&nbsp; At the moment the market penetration of room air conditioners (RACs) is only 4-5%, roughly where it was in China in 1995 (compared to a c.53% market penetration in China today). &nbsp;<strong>The projected growth of RAC in India as incomes increase could result in additional peak loads of 143 GW (about twice the total UK installed capacity!), requiring 300 additional 500 MW power stations.</strong> &nbsp;Work is currently under way on a national cooling strategy which aims to mitigate the growth in power demand from cooling and will include measures such as enhanced efficiency regulations on RACs, driving innovation in cooling, promotion of passive cooling, and district cooling using trigeneration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) is a central player in the Indian energy efficiency market.&nbsp; EESL was established in 2009 by the Ministry of Power as a JV of four utilities, the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), Rural Electrification Corporation (REC), Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Power Grid Corporation (PGICL).&nbsp; The vision behind EESL is to unlock the $11 billion market for energy efficiency, amounting to 15% of present consumption.&nbsp; EESL works closely with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency and leads the market related activities of the National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency.&nbsp; From 2009 to 2013 little progress was made and then there was a change of leadership that led to amazing results, including growing revenues 46 times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EESL is best known for its LED programme, UJALA, which has distributed more than 270 million LEDs across India. &nbsp;<strong>EESL’s model of aggregating demand and large scale procurement has driven the price of LEDs down by a factor of ten</strong>.&nbsp; Critically the UJALA programme does not rely on any subsidies, it is a commercial model in which consumers and utilities pay as they save.&nbsp; The savings have been around $338 million. &nbsp;Another effect of the growth of the LED market has been a surge in domestic manufacturing.&nbsp; LED production in India has grown from 5 million units in 2013 to 600 million units in 2017, creating 185,000 jobs in 2016/17.&nbsp; The UJALA programme aims to replace 770 million LEDs by 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A similar aggregation approach has been applied by EESL to replacing street lighting</strong>. As well as using LEDs EESL has implemented a Centralised Control and Monitoring System (CCMS) for street lighting that provides remote monitoring 24×7.&nbsp; Globally we have started to recognise the importance of non-energy strategic benefits of energy efficiency and EESL has taken steps to measure these through social audits which show that citizens are a lot more satisfied with the LED lighting and feel an enhanced sense of safety and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>EESL has also moved into several other key areas including agricultural pumps, domestic appliances, smart meters and electric vehicles (EVs).</strong> Towards the end of 2017 EESL procured 10,000 EVs to lease to government departments (which have a huge fleet of cars for the use of officials).&nbsp; The procurement brought the price of the EVs down by 25%. EESL will lease the EVs and charging infrastructure to departments for less than they currently pay for petrol driven cars. A further procurement of EVs will follow.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>As the world’s largest publicly owned super-ESCO EESL has been remarkably successful.&nbsp; It has been highlighted by the International Energy Agency and the World Bank as a model for deploying energy efficiency at scale and it is certainly a model that all countries can learn from, North as well as South.</strong>&nbsp; At EnergyPro we are proud to be working with EESL to combine both sets of experience to build a portfolio of projects in Europe and beyond.</p>

1135,"When is the grid “full”?",NULL,NULL,"<p>Recently, I&nbsp;wrote about&nbsp;the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://energytransition.org/2018/01/new-germany-energy-commitments-take-shape/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">latest negotiation results for a new German government</a>. On Sunday, the Social Democrats adopted the proposal for a new grand coalition – a repeat with the Christian Democrats – albeit with a lukewarm 56% of voting members. The country is now set to get a continuation of the old coalition that few seem to want, including the coalition partners themselves.</p>
<p>But the new grand coalition will not be the same as the old; the platforms differ. The ambitions for renewables and climate protection are greater than before, though details are still lacking. For instance, an additional 4 GW of solar and 4 GW of wind are to be added by 2020 “if the grid can absorb the electricity.” How do you tell whether the grid can take more?</p>
<h3>Negative prices and “EinsMan”</h3>

<p>There are two potential starting points: negative power prices and curtailment of renewable electricity. The latter is referred to in German as “EinsMan,” which is short for “feed-in management.” Let’s take each of these in order.</p>
<p>The number of hours with negative power prices has been on the rise over the past few years, as shown below. But this metric only indirectly pertains to grid capacity; it more precisely shows cases when demand for power from conventional plants drops so low that it becomes cheaper (because of technical constraints) for these plants to pay customers to off-take electricity to avoid ramping down further.</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""375"" height=""276"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/ea1e6fb2bf.png"" width=""500"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p>Source:&nbsp;Energiewende 2017 State of Affairs</p>
<p>Furthermore, negative prices apply in the entire price zone for both the German and Austrian grids. There is only one price signal then for this entire area, but grid congestion occurs locally, not across all of Germany and Austria at once. Here, we need to revert to a more precise metric: “EinsMan”. Grid operators are allowed to curtail electricity from wind, solar, biogas, cogeneration, and mine gas when specific sections of the grid are endangered.</p>
<p>The amount of renewable electricity curtailed skyrocketed from 2013 to 2015. After falling in 2016, it rose again slightly in 2017 according to preliminary figures.</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""376"" height=""375"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/1cdc126bbd.png"" width=""500"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p><em>The green line represents the total amount of renewable electricity curtailed; it never reached 1% of total German power generation (around 6,000 GWh). Most of the curtailed electricity is on shore wind power (blue line); little solar is curtailed (yellow line) probably because much of it is connected at the low-voltage distribution level, whereas curtailment occurs at the high and medium-voltage levels. Schleswig-Holstein is the state where most curtailment occurs (dotted line)</em><em><em>.</em> Source: Ubimet.</em></p>
<p>Ubimet, a service provider,&nbsp;already <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.ubimet.com/loesungen/einsman-losungen/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">visualizes&nbsp;the EinsMan data</a>, which are available by postal code, and combines them with weather data, renewable power forecasts, standard load profiles, grid topology, and load flow calculations&nbsp;to produce a forecast. Policymakers don’t even need the forecast, which wouldn’t be available for a whole year anyway; the data for the previous year could be used to show where grid congestion occurs, and wind farms could be excluded from auctions within that postal code unless the grid had been expanded in that area.</p>
<p>But no one I spoke with expects this to happen. Angela Pietroni of think tank Energy Brainpool says the requirement for grid capacity could just be “a loophole to limit the auction volumes.” To make matters worse, Andreas Jahn of the Regulatory Assistance Project (RAP) says that there is a lack of transparency in grid data in general, including with re-dispatches – when the grid operator requests that a conventional plant change its output immediately to stabilize the grid. (See our previous report entitled&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://energytransition.org/2015/08/blacked-out-german-grid/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Blacked out German grid</a>.) But he also points out that most wind and solar are connected at lower voltage levels on the grid; re-dispatches take place at higher levels.</p>
<p>The question of transparent grid data is entering the foreground in Germany. Over at Energy Post,&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://energypost.eu/time-german-network-operators-come-clean-tariffs/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Jahn sums up</a>&nbsp;the main issues, including a ruling by the German Constitutional Court last year that revenue from the grid must be more open. The case was brought by green power provider Lichtblick, which points out that grid fees are now the biggest single part of retail power prices – and it’s hard to verify these fees independently. Grid operators are considered natural monopolies; as such, they propose prices to regulators, who need transparent data to confirm proposed fees. “Withholding relevant data is a violation of EU law,” he adds.</p>
<p>In other words, Germany could make the construction of new renewable energy projects more advanced by discouraging, if not ruling out, new builds in areas with a defined level of grid congestion – we have the data. Alternatively, policymakers could use grid congestion to incentivize local electricity-to-heat; the excess green power would then not be curtailed, but used as a heat source. Section 13, para 6a of the 2017 Energy Management Act (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/enwg_2005/__13.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">in German</a>) is a starting point but doesn’t yet apply to wind and solar.</p>
<p>Whether the current debate over the transparency of grid data will help or hamper such advances is anyone’s guess at present.</p>

<p>EEIP will present the <strong>ICP project during a <em>mobile VR event</em> at Hannover Messe 2018</strong>!<br /> More <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/events/detailed/7a4251e348d24da682f854ccdf34d856/virtual-reality-at-hannover-messe-2018/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a></p>
<p>.............................</p>

<p>It is encouraging to see in the press that the rate of growth of the global economy is picking up.&nbsp; In Europe, the economy is expected to grow at the fastest pace in a decade.&nbsp; This is equally true in America and in Asia.&nbsp; This is great news for industry but also reason for some concern because, with all regions growing, those who are most competitive are going to gain in the long run. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One area to improve competitiveness is to ensure costs are minimised.&nbsp; For many industries, particularly those that are energy intensive, that means ensuring investments in the most energy-efficient technologies in parallel with good energy management practices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, evidence shows that investment in energy-efficient technologies is occurring at a lower rate than should be, especially since borrowing rates are so low.&nbsp; It could be because energy prices have been relatively low, even though we have seen oil prices in particular increasing in recent months.&nbsp; While individual plants may have reduced dependence on petroleum products in their production facilities, overall fossil fuel consumption remains high. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You know the situation in your own business, your own sector, your own country.&nbsp; <strong>You probably also know what you need to do in your facility since the first round of mandatory audits in the EU have taken place.</strong>&nbsp; If your company is above a certain size, the audit would have been undertaken and you know what actions/investments are recommended. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Have you acted?</strong>&nbsp; If so, you are seen to be a minority in Europe.&nbsp; Most are still deliberating what to do.&nbsp; Either that or they have tucked away the audit report in some obscure filing cabinet and assigned it to history. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no need for me to ask why you have taken such action – or inaction.&nbsp; There is some help, however. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>How ICP an help &nbsp;</h3>

<p>One of the <strong>major barriers identified in investing in energy efficiency is the lack of standardisation of the process.</strong>&nbsp; The process is essentially the interaction between the asset owner/manager and the project developer (an energy service company, an installation or engineer company). &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many factors that influence decisions and action. The <em>Investor Confidence Project</em> is there to remove many of the complications and risks in improving your company’s energy performance. It ensures that the process of choosing what to do, how to do it and how to finance it is standardised, giving you assurance. It can help senior management better understand energy efficiency from a strategic perspective because it does remove risk. &nbsp;</p>
<p>ICP brought to Europe to develop a system to give confidence to all active stakeholders. There are still concerns that investing in energy efficiency is risky. ICP is designed to change that. ICP started with investments in buildings and is now broadening the scope to include industry, district energy and street lighting through a two-year project funded by the European Commission. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of ICP is relatively simple to understand. A potential project in a factory or a district heating system, for example, is identified. Someone has to do the necessary calculations to determine the viability. Someone has to be identified to install it (often the same organisation). And some organisation needs to fund it. What this project does is standardise the procedures so that all players gain confidence in the system. The factory owner is happy. The developer/auditor/installer is happy. The financial institution is happy. There are protocols in place and third party monitoring to ensure everything is done correctly. The protocols are developed by interested experts and not by commercial interests. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The project will work with all of those involved in the project cycle from owners through to project developers and verifiers. They all have a key role to play.&nbsp; To ensure that the protocols are robust, technical forums are being set up to review the draft protocols and provide important technical input to their development. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For <strong>asset owners or managers</strong>, the ICP approach will provide transparency of the process and will give them the confidence in implementing the measures. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For the <strong>project developer</strong>, ICP provides a process that is understood and accepted by all participants. This will reduce transaction costs and should minimise any misunderstandings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For the <strong>financial community</strong>, the ICP approach will standardise the project development process and bring the necessary confidence to undertake the investments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Importantly, ICP Europe Investor Network is comprised of energy efficiency investors who recognise the benefit of industry best practice and standardised energy renovation project delivery.&nbsp; Members of the Network support the use of the ICP Protocols and Credentialing System because these systems increase confidence in project performance while reducing due diligence-related transaction costs. ICP Investor Network represents €1.5 billion in energy efficiency project capital. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>ICP Europe also has a wide range of allies. The ICP Europe Ally Network provides valuable input and advice on the development and deployment of the programs and products of ICP Europe. These organisations have agreed to support the goals of ICP Europe: reducing energy efficiency projects performance risk, lowering transaction costs and increasing project demand. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Next steps &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The protocols for larger industrial projects and for targeted industrial projects have been prepared and published. The training for project developers will begin in the next couple of months. &nbsp;</p>
<p>ICP is now looking for <strong>pilot projects</strong> to ensure all elements of the ICP process are ready for full market deployment.&nbsp; If you would like your company to participate, please contact me via <a href=""mailto:rod.janssen@ee-ip.org"">rod.janssen@ee-ip.org</a>&nbsp;</p>

1137,"Utilities and Governments are Wasting Millions of Dollars Subsidizing A Wrong Technology for Motor Systems Efficiency",NULL,NULL,"
<p>According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), electric motor systems consume more than half of global electricity. Industrial electric motor systems account for over 70% of total global industrial electricity usage. Electric motors operate fans; pumps; and materials-handling, compressed-air, and processing equipment.</p>
<p>Because motor efficiency improvements will only marginally increase the motor system’s efficiency, we must look to <strong>improve the efficiency of the equipment and systems being driven by the motor.</strong> Optimization measures such as predictive maintenance, avoiding oversized motors, and matching motor systems to specific needs, etc. could improve the energy efficiency of motor-driven systems significantly. <strong>Even more savings can be achieved by looking not only beyond the motor to the whole motor system but beyond the system to the end-use device</strong>, as shown in Figure below.</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""379"" height=""390"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/ffad2e3e7a.png"" width=""750"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p>Figure. Illustration of two industrial electric motor-driven systems: (a) normal and (b) efficient (IEA 2016)</p>
<p>The traditional approach in most states and countries has been to focus on motors only and not on entire motor systems. As shown above, while increasing motor efficiency saves energy, optimizing the entire pump system will save much more energy. There is a need to shift the paradigm to focus on systems rather than individual motor efficiency. Programs and policies that target systems can save more energy and CO2 emissions in a more cost-effective manner than programs that focus only on motors.</p>
<p>Many utilities in the U.S. and governments around the world give substantial rebate for replacing electric motors with more efficient ones. While this may sound like a good thing to do,&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.globalefficiencyintel.com/us-industrial-motor-systems-ee-reports"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">our extensive studies for 30 states in the U.S.</a>&nbsp;and over 10 countries around the world shows that it is a clear waste of money. Why? Because in most cases, replacing existing motor with a more efficient one can improve the entire system efficiency by 1% - 5% (depending on the baseline efficiency of the systems). On the other hand, there are many other systems efficiency/optimization measures that can result in up to 20% - 25% efficiency improvement in the system.</p>
<p>For example, in a pump system with a Low efficiency baseline, replacing motor can only improve system efficiency by 5%, while trimming or changing impeller to match output to requirements can save about 15%, removing sediment/scale buildup from piping can save about 10% and installing variable speed drive (VSD) can save about 25% of the electricity use.</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""380"" height=""342"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/f818afb2a9.jpg"" width=""500"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p>There is another very important reason why giving rebate for replacing motors with more efficient ones is such a waste of money in a massive scale. Our analysis consistently showed that replacing motor with more efficient one is by far one of the least cost-effective efficiency measures that can be implement on a motor system (for example in a pump systems or a fan systems). In other words, it cost much higher to save a kWh of electricity by replacing motor than to implement other system efficiency/optimization measures.</p>
<p>So, you might ask why many utilities and government prioritize giving rebate for replacing motors? The answer is it’s easier to implement and measure the saving. Utilities and government staff and program managers often need to show the amount of electricity saved as a result of implementing a rebate program. This is easier to do with equipment replacement than with soft measures such as system optimization. Having this said, many of the system optimization measures are easy to implement by in-house staff in the facilities.</p>
<p>To sum up, our detailed and extensive studies for three major industrial motor systems (pump systems, fan systems, and compressor systems) shows that millions of dollars spent annually by utilities and governments on rebate program for replacing electric motors with more efficient one is clearly waste of public and private funding. The better way would be to provide rebate for system efficiency measures that can save sometime up to 10 times higher energy saving with lower cost.</p>
<p>If utilities and governments persist to keep their motor replacement rebate program, my suggestion to them, based on the findings of our reports, is to bundle one or two efficiency measures with the motor replacement rebate. In other words, for an applicant to quality for motor replacement rebate, they should also implement one or two other system optimization measures from a list of measures that is predefined by utilities or government agencies.</p>

1138,"The HERA Group, from local utility to global sustainable development. A unique approach that could change the way utilities do business around the world",NULL,NULL,"<p>Today I want to bring to the attention of the reader&nbsp;The Hera Group&nbsp;(Gruppo Hera), an Italian multi-utility that with its unique business strategy respects the environment while creating shared value to its customers. The company brings innovation on all fronts, from&nbsp;Circular Economy,&nbsp;Utility 4.0,&nbsp;Smart City, to&nbsp;Customer Experience. Let’s start from the beginning.</p>
<p>Hera (Holding Energia Risorse Ambiente) was created in 2002 as the first Italian experiment in the&nbsp;combination of council-owned companies&nbsp;into a single multi-utility&nbsp;to optimize their respective assets and provide for efficient and integrated services to their customers. Hera is mainly a publicly-owned company, where the shareholder municipalities are united under a shareholders’ agreement. The company operates in over 350 municipalities in the Italian regions of Emilia Romagna, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Marche, Tuscany, and Veneto. Today Hera is one of&nbsp;Italy’s biggest local utility companies, a leader in&nbsp;energy,&nbsp;waste management,&nbsp;and water&nbsp;services, serving more than 4 million citizens. The energy services include electricity, gas, and district heating.</p>
<p>This article focuses on Hera’s innovative business approach, and how the company delivers shared values while contributing to the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Hera’s unique approach and innovative strategy</h3>

<p>Hera’s strategic drivers are innovation, efficiency, growth, excellence, and agility.&nbsp;Sustainability has been at the center&nbsp;of the business strategy since its establishment. In 2016, the company decided to move forward to take an active role in the&nbsp;2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations&nbsp;and&nbsp;its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)&nbsp;[i].&nbsp;</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col"">&nbsp;</th> 		</tr> 	</thead> </table>

<p>The new strategic approach includes&nbsp;creating Shared Value&nbsp;to Corporate Social Responsibility (CRS) and sustainability to maximize&nbsp;the value&nbsp;creation for both the company and the community in which it operates. The shared value is originated by the operating profits from all the activities and projects in line with the priorities of the Global Agenda. According to Hera, this new approach will allow to:</p>

<ul> 	<li>“Improve the company’s performance in terms of environmental and social sustainability; mostly related to business management and also to industry standards;</li> 	<li>generate operating profit margins responding to “Global Agenda” priorities”[ii].</li> </ul>
<h3>Act local, think global&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Hera&nbsp;covers 10 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals,&nbsp;and categorizes the identified priorities in three main drivers of change:&nbsp;efficient use of resources,&nbsp;smart use of energy, and&nbsp;innovation and development.</p>
<p>In 2016 the shared value accounted for&nbsp;33% of Hera’s Operating Profit Margin (OPM),&nbsp;approximately 300 million euro[iii]. Major highlights include a&nbsp;7.6%&nbsp;reduction of municipal waste disposal&nbsp;to a landfill (ahead of schedule to comply with the European Union targets set for 2030), a&nbsp;2.6%&nbsp;reduction of the energy consumption&nbsp;compared to 2013, with a goal of 5% by 2020,&nbsp;a&nbsp;10% carbon footprint drop&nbsp;for the energy production,&nbsp;with a target of 19% by 2020 compared to 2015, and&nbsp;more than 70%&nbsp;energy production from renewable&nbsp;and assimilated sources[iv]. Furthermore, the company made a commitment to&nbsp;power all Hera Spa’s activities in the Emilia-Romagna region with&nbsp;100% renewable energy[v].</p>
<p>The following infographic visualizes Hera’s strategic priorities aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the areas of impact, and the 2016 achievements:</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col"">&nbsp;</th> 		</tr> 	</thead> </table>

<h3>Innovation @ 360°</h3>

<p>Hera is fully committed to innovation. The utility sector is receiving increasingly pressure from both regulatory and technological side, with new technology and new competitors disrupting the way utility do business. For this reason, innovation is key in Hera’s strategy.&nbsp;</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col"">&nbsp;</th> 		</tr> 	</thead> </table>

<p>The company embraced the&nbsp;Circular Economy&nbsp;concept, by recently joining the CE100 programme[vi]&nbsp;of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Hera’s commitment include both the&nbsp;not-renewable materials management&nbsp;through an increase of programmes and projects for recycling, reuse and redistribute, renovate and repair, and the&nbsp;renewable resources management&nbsp;with the production of renewable energy from organic waste through anaerobic bio-digestion plants, and high-quality compost. Hera has planned the construction of a biorefinery to produce bio-methane, also for automotive use, from the end of 2018, and has targeted experimental projects to&nbsp;produce advanced biofuels from prunings and wastewater treatment sludge[vii].</p>
<p>Another innovation comes from its contribution toward&nbsp;Smart Cities. Hera is investing and introducing new technologies to improve the living conditions in the cities in which operates and the overall services delivered to the public. Projects aim at the improvement of&nbsp;urban quality&nbsp;through the monitoring of environmental parameters,&nbsp;sustainable mobility&nbsp;through the development of charging stations for vehicles and bicycles, and development of&nbsp;city energy maps&nbsp;to assess historical performance of energy consumption and predict future performances. The ultimate goal is to develop a&nbsp;big data model&nbsp;able to combine and process the collected data and to improve efficiency in an integrated way[viii].</p>
<p>Hera is a&nbsp;Utility 4.0, with its&nbsp;drone-based electricity grid control&nbsp;to inspect the lines visually to quickly identify malfunctions and promptly repair them, and the&nbsp;IOSight project for advanced plant monitoring, a system that allows the plant’s real-time performances by integrating remote control data with the plant information (size, volume, assets, etc.). These innovative control and monitoring systems allows for a more efficient and smooth running of operations while reducing time of repair and the overall costs[ix].</p>
<p>Lastly, Hera listens to its consumers’ needs and desires, and understands the needs of the local community. Based on this, the company offers a new bill, which is more transparent, easy to understand, and shows the customer’s consumption trends and highlights the key figures. In addition, Hera launched a successful “Stop paper bills, give your city a tree” campaign&nbsp;to promotes online bill, having more than 150,000 customers signing up in the past four years[x].&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Considerations</h3>
<p>The utility sector is changing rapidly all over the world. Today many new actors are on the market, and innovative business models and technologies can disrupt the way utilities do business. Hera had the vision to incorporate sustainability in its business strategy since the beginning and to include the global challenges as a new approach. The company also invests in innovation as a way to improve its overall competitiveness. This not only makes the company stronger on the market, but also makes it actively contributing to the challenges the world is facing today.</p>
<p>The Hera Group is a great example of how utilities can redefine their business around sustainability without losing profits. Besides, consumers are changing their behavior toward a more sustainable energy, and business in general, and those needs must be taken into account by the local utilities.</p>

1139,"UPDATE - ICP: Top 2 benefits for energy efficiency project developers",NULL,NULL,"<p>ICP (Investor Confidence Project Europe) delivers a standardised framework for developing energy efficiency projects to reduce uncertainty for clients and investors – to help grow the number of projects and the energy efficiency finance market.</p>
<p>Frameworks already exists for buildings and are now being developed for projects in industry, district energy and street lighting.</p>
<p>The first new framework on industry was launched December 2017. <strong>And we are now looking for project developers to apply this framework in pilot projects.</strong></p>
<p>As a project developer, you will ask the question “what´s in it for me” and here is the answer:</p>
<h3>Top 2 benefits why project developers should apply the ICP framework</h3>
<p><strong>No1: Get more clients </strong><br /> A key barrier for industrial clients to start a new energy efficiency project lies in the uncertainty about the outcome, the difference between the “promises” and the “real savings” generated.<br /> This is where the ICP framework comes into play. It is a technology neutral and certifiable process description ensuring that best practices are applied throughout the development of the project. The framework has been developed together with the financial community to help lenders and investors have greater confidence in project outcomes, which basically means an ICP project is more likely to deliver against its promises.<br /> Increased confidence obviously works both ways, it benefits your clients as they can trust that they get what is promised. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For a project developer, <strong>applying the ICP framework becomes a sales argument</strong>: “We will deliver against our promise. You can trust us as we are applying the ICP framework which has been developed by the industry and financial institutions.” &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>No2: Free marketing support </strong><br /> The ICP project in Europe is co-financed by the European Commission (<strong>again, think about trust!</strong>) and EEIP, the largest global industry network for energy efficiency is a partner. Part of EEIP´s contribution is to promote those project developers applying the ICP framework.<br /> As well as the entire energy intensive industry in Europe, EEIP covers the industrial value chain from end to end, which means EEIP is reaching out to all your current and potential clients. &nbsp;</p>
<p>EEIP will tell them that you are a professional project developer using highest standards to deliver against your promises.<br /> And EEIP will also recommend any potential client to “request” project developers to apply the ICP standards. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Reason To Believe &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The underlying objective of the Investor Confidence Project Europe is to help unlock access to financing for the building, industry, district energy and street lighting markets by standardising how energy efficiency projects are developed, documented and measured. Standardization using best practices set out by ICP reduces the risk for investors in regard to the projected outcome of an energy efficiency project. It also reduces time and skills needed by investors to perform due diligence for each individual project. Finally, it reduces transaction costs. These factors open the door for more capital to finance such projects or re-finance investments of project developers and ESCOs.</p>
<p><strong>A side benefit of such a standard is logically that it increases also the certainty for clients of energy efficiency projects that projected energy savings will be delivered.</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<h3>The origin &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The logic behind the ICP approach links back to the outcome of an initiative called Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG), established in 2013 by the European Commission Directorate-General for Energy (DG Energy) and United Nations Environment Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). EEFIG created an open dialogue and work platform for public and private financial institutions, industry representatives and sector experts to identify the barriers to the long-term financing for energy efficiency and proposed policy and market solutions to them. EEFIG has engaged 120 active participants from 100 organizations to deliver clear and unambiguous messages. EEFIG recommended adopting the ICP to Europe and it was introduced in 2015 with the support of Horizon 2020 funding.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h3>The ICP structure</h3>
<p>ICP uses an approach originally developed in the US for the buildings sector. In Europe, it was first adopted for buildings through a project financed by the EC. Now ICP is tackling industry, dristrict energy and street lighting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ICP is based on two foundations:</p>
<ol> 	<li><strong>The ICP framework </strong><br /> 	The ICP framework assembles best practices and existing technical standards into a set of Protocols that define a clear roadmap for developing projects, determining savings estimates, and documenting and verifying results.</li> 	<li><strong>Independant 3rd party certification </strong><br /> 	ICP's Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ (IREE™) is an international certification that insures best practices, the right professionals and third-party validation are used to deliver high-quality projects that you can bank on.&nbsp;</li> </ol>
<h3>What´s happening right now – and how project developers can engage&nbsp;</h3>
<p>ICP Protocols for industry are ready and available to be applied in projects. Right now. The protocols for district energy and street lighting will be available early 2018. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How the development of protocols is organised – and how you can participate</strong><br /> Engaging in the development of protocols (the ICP framework) is easy and allows project developers to shape the final product across Europe. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The ICP technical team together with internationally recognised experts are developing a draft which will then be shared with the Technical Forum which acts as the leading technical advisory group to input, discuss and feedback. This process is organised in an iterative way. The Technical Forum is open to all interested experts and the whole process is open source. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Technical Forum</strong><br /> As a Technical Forum member (register here: <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/technical-forum.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">http://europe.eeperformance.org/technical-forum.html </a>) you</p>
<ul> 	<li>receive a draft of the latest protocol in development</li> 	<li>are invited to comment anytime</li> 	<li>are invited to join the Technical Forum webinar where drafts are shared and discussed</li> </ul>
<p>The Technical Forum Industry has delivered the ICP industry protocol. However, the Forum remains open as a sharing and networking group. And it ensures you receive all updates and latest developments, e.g. the translated training material in German language...</p>

<p>Prior to each webinar discussion round, technical Forum Members receive the latest status of the protocol for their own preparation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Estimated time investment is 2-3h per round including the webinar. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Which means with a few hours of time investment, you will not only amongst the first in the market to know everything about the new “market standards” but also be able to actively shape them!</p>
<p><strong>Training and support </strong><br /> To apply the protocol to your own energy efficiency projects with your clients, you obviously need to familiarize yourself with the protocol and how it is applied.<br /> To do so, ICP offers s 2-step support for pilot projects (pilot projects are all projects at least starting before May 2019). This <strong>support is free to project developers and owners</strong> as it is funded by Horizon 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step1: An open training webinar for all (industry date to be published soon).<br /> Step2: A 1:1 training session with project developer / the project developer team followed by specific technical asssistance as required to get the pilot project certified.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Summary and call to action &nbsp;</h3>

<p>Applying the ICP framework for energy efficiency projects gives you a competitive advantage in the market, more business, better re-financing opportunities and – as part of the ICP EU co-funded project – free marketing support in all European countries and free technical assistance to adopt the ICP system.</p>

1140,"Delivering Energy Efficiency in Industry: How the Hera Group turned an obligation into an innovative and successful business strategy",NULL,NULL,"<p>In my last article, I introduced the Hera Group, an Italian multi-utility owned for the majority by local municipalities, and portrayed its unique approach to global sustainable development.</p>
<p>Today the focus is on&nbsp;<strong>Hera’s leading role in delivering energy efficiency in industry</strong>. Hera committed to energy efficiency more than ten years ago, and from what started as an obligation, it turned out to be one of the most successful and innovative approaches of the group. From 2005 to 2016 Hera delivered&nbsp;<strong>205 energy-saving projects in the industrial sector for a total savings of 364,000 toe</strong>[i], which is equal to the annual electricity and gas consumption of 256,000 families. In December 2014 the Group obtained the<strong>&nbsp;ISO 50001 certification</strong>[ii]&nbsp;for seven of its companies[iii], thus strengthening its already solid commitment to energy efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>From obligation…</h3>

<p>As gas and electricity distributor, Hera is obliged under the&nbsp;<strong>Italian White Certificate (WhC) scheme</strong>&nbsp;to meet pre-defined annual energy savings target since 2005[iv]. The company decided to fulfill these obligations by&nbsp;<strong>originating WhC through energy efficiency projects</strong>, rather than purchase them from third parties, a path that is not common among utilities.</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""381"" height=""99"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/ce0cade671.png"" width=""515"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p>Hera started the journey to meet its requirement by implementing energy savings projects at its own facilities. Measures included, among others, efficiency improvements for treatment plants, innovative solutions for public lighting, and decompression of natural gas, for a total of&nbsp;<strong>94 internal projects&nbsp;and&nbsp;total savings amounting at 82,015 toe</strong>&nbsp;from 2005 to 2016[v].&nbsp;</p>

<h3>… to business opportunity</h3>

<p>Building on the internal experience on energy savings projects in combination with WhC, Hera decided to use its extensive technical know-how and make it available for the industrial operators outside the company. Today Hera provides a&nbsp;<strong>complete package of energy services </strong>that include energy audits, identification of energy saving opportunities, application for the WhC, project development, and energy data monitoring on a&nbsp;<strong>no-fee basis</strong>. Once identified the energy saving project, Hera enters into an agreement with the industrial partner about the company’s role, type of support or service offered, the cost, and the WhC revenues sharing. Every agreement is different and depends on the size and complexity of the project. Consequently,&nbsp;<strong>Hera assumes all the risks and the costs</strong>&nbsp;until the energy saving project is developed and bankable[vi].</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""382"" height=""360"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/e51ff8dd12.png"" width=""585"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p>Hera leverages the expertise of the industrial partner through its participation during the entire process, from opportunities identification to project development. Furthermore, the company maintains a network of consultants and technological partners to make sure to deliver the best-customized solution that maximizes savings.</p>
<p>From 2005 to 2016 Hera delivered&nbsp;<strong>111 energy saving projects</strong>&nbsp;with external companies across numerous industrial sectors from food processing, textile ceramic, plastic &amp; metal, manufacturing, and chemical industry, obtaining&nbsp;<strong>energy savings in the amount of 282,317 toe</strong>[vii]. Project interventions included, among others, cooking/drying, furnace, heat recovery systems, upgrading of refrigeration systems, mechanical vapour recompression, advanced control systems, and global process optimization. The following chart illustrates some examples of the projects Hera implemented during 2016.</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""383"" height=""321"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/7b3ecfbd82.png"" width=""551"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>


<h3>Attractive payback period</h3>

<p>The majority of energy efficiency interventions that Hera identifies have a&nbsp;<strong>payback period below 5 years</strong>,&nbsp;thus making the projects more appealing for industrial companies. This is made possible by the additional revenues from the WhC, which significantly reduces the payback period.</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""384"" height=""105"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/6c71ae0c93.png"" width=""508"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p>Obliged parties are granted a fixed annual tariff contribution to cover part of the costs incurred to achieve their energy efficiency quota. This is a great advantage for Hera, as the company is not affected by the market risk from trading the WhC on the spot market, allowing Hera to provide&nbsp;<strong>guaranteed energy savings</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>risk-free access to WhC incentives&nbsp;</strong>to the external industrial operators.</p>
<p>The following case study shows how the discounted payback period is reduced to 3 years thanks to the use of WhC, compared to 6 years without the incentive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""385"" height=""429"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/325de93d27.png"" width=""551"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>


<h3>Transferring internal know-how and building trust</h3>
<p>A great example of how&nbsp;Hera <strong>transferred its internal know-how</strong>&nbsp;is reflected in a project they implemented to increase the efficiency of biological oxidation blowers of the wastewater treatment plant connected to the sugar refinery of the Zuccherificio COPROB (Pontelongo, Italy). Hera had extensive internal competence in the optimization of their wastewater treatment plants and was able to transfer it to the external company. From the mandatory energy audit of 2015, Hera identified the energy savings potential and was able to present the project under the WhC scheme in 2017. This not only shows Hera’s&nbsp;<strong>technical proficiencies</strong>&nbsp;but also its&nbsp;<strong>capability to build trust</strong>&nbsp;with the industrial partner. Hera has a great relationship with the Zuccherificio COPROB and extreme trust, having presented four successfully approved WhC projects with them.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Considerations</h3>
<p>Delivering energy efficiency in industry in an attractive and cost-effective way is possible and proven. The Hera Group, an obliged party under the Italian WhC scheme to meet annual energy savings, has implemented several projects and delivered concrete savings since 2005. The WhC scheme has definitely played a key role in mobilizing the industry and allowing the design of bankable energy savings projects. Hera, with its strong commitment to energy efficiency, has turned this obligation into an innovative and successful business strategy, by capitalising its internal know-how and exporting it to the external industrial partners.</p>
<p>Energy efficiency is a win-win situation for all the actors involved, and with the great amount of energy savings potential in the industrial sector, we certainly need more companies like Hera.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Energy Efficiency is boring</h3>

<p>We cannot even count time how often we heard this in the last ten years. It is often perceievd as if it lacks buzz of renewables, even of energy storage or hydrogen.</p>



<p>Us working in energy efficiency know that this is not the case. The exciting mix of technologies, people motivation, innovation and environmental benefits, all make energy efficiency as the hottest energy-related topic. Since 2011, <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/about/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes (EEIP)</strong></a>, global industrial energy efficiency business and policy network, has been riding on a wave of innovating outreach via innovative engagement and social media, now we have employed virtual reality (VR) to push further the excitement of technologies and solutions.</p>
<p><a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://youtu.be/o7yTYGglnGQ"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>Check out this 15sec video</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Join with a free mobileVR headset</strong></p>
<p>The solution we have choosen works simultaniously via laptop, mobile and full VR. The good thing is - nearly everybody has a mobile. The bad thing - not many have a mobileVR headset.<br /> This is why we will provide up to 50 ""physical"" participants with a mobileVR headset. And the best thing - you can take them home afterwards!</p>
<p>That´s how it looks like</p>

<h3><strong>About the event - the ICP project</strong></h3>
<p>ICP stands for Investor Confidence Project. This European project unlocks capital for energy efficiency projects. It is doing so by standardizing how energy efficiency projects are developed, documented and measured delivering two benefits:</p>
<ol> 	<li>makes projects ""bankable""</li> 	<li>increases certainty that projected savings are materializing</li> </ol>
<p>ICP is not only supported by many stakeholders, the so called ""ICP allies"" but also by an<strong> <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/investors.html#!directory"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Investor network representing € 1,5 billion</a></strong> in energy efficiency project capital.<br /> ICP works for industry, street lighting, district energy and buildings. It allows for project credentialing based on the application of so called ""protocols"", developed by industry experts across Europe.</p>
<p>Here you can find the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www2.ee-ip.org/company/CompanyPage/show/i3cp-europe/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>core documents for ICP industry</strong></a></p>
<p>Being funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, it also covers free training, certification and application support throughout the project duration.</p>

<h3>Who should attend the mobileVR event</h3>
<p>Well, you might want to attend being curious about how such an event looks like - and need a free mobileVR device :-). However, this ICP mobileVR event is most relevant for</p>
<ul> 	<li>ESCOs (Energy Service Companies) / project developers</li> 	<li>Equipment producer (motors, pumps, compressors, ...)</li> 	<li>External (funds, banks) and internal investors (CFO)</li> 	<li>Companies with an interest to use VR for own communications (product presentations, trainings, customer engagement, ...)</li> </ul>
<h3>How to attend - some technicalities...</h3>
<p>Joining the event via a mobileVR headset is easy. But, and there is always a ""but""... it requires 3 little steps to prepare:</p>
<ol> 	<li><strong>Registration in the VR environment - we do this for you</strong><br /> 	We will pre-set-up guest accounts which you can use during Hannover Messe. We will even pre-dress-up your avatar (50% female, 50% male)</li> 	<li><strong>Check your mobile + app - at our booth H12, D45 (Mo, Tue, Wed till noon)</strong><br /> 	Your mobile should not be too old (2-3 years is usually fine) and it only works on Android so far. We have ready to use mobileVR headsets so we can quickly check if it works with your mobile. And it is necessary to download the VR app which we can do together.</li> 	<li><strong>How to move and act inside VR - again at our booth H12, D45</strong><br /> 	For the event, we are only using a two functionalities: move and click. We will show you at our booth how to do so. Effectively, there is only one button at the mobileVR headset, so it is not really complex</li> </ol>
<h3>Contact to attend &amp; more</h3>
<p>In case you are interested to attend our VR event at the Hannover Messe, please just contact <a class=""mail"" href=""mailto:juergen.ritzek@ee-ip.org"" title=""Opens window for sending email"">juergen.ritzek@ee-ip.org</a></p>
<p><strong>You cannot make it to the Hannover Messe but want to attend, too?</strong><br /> You can join the event from any place in the world by just using your PC or mobile. To do so, you would need to register yourself (free) and join the VR world at the time of the event. Attention: you can also enter the VR world at any time. Things might not look perfect until the Hannover Messe as we are preparing - and testing :-).</p>
<p>If you want we can also meet up there for a chat prior to the Hannover Messe. in this case, please drop me a mail for organising a meeting ""insideVR"" (<a class=""mail"" href=""mailto:juergen.ritzek@ee-ip.org"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">juergen.ritzek@ee-ip.org</a>)</p>

<p>Recently, I wrote to the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/articles/detailed/e2ed1ea3e5b9a762413430d5c64e512a/too-good-to-be-true-not-really-a-word-to-the-captains-of-industry/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>“captains of industry</strong>”</a> to encourage them to join our approach to de-risking industrial energy efficiency investments.&nbsp; We call it the Investor Confidence Project and this phase is funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 programme.&nbsp; We know we need to accelerate the rate of investing in industrial energy efficiency and this process shows considerable promise to be a major solution. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As I stated, the project will work with all of those involved in the project cycle from owners through to project developers and verifiers. They all have a key role to play.&nbsp; The <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/uploads/8/6/5/0/8650231/icp_technical_forum_for_industry_members_list.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">protocols were prepared in the project with the help and guidance of many of you</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply: &nbsp;</p>

<ul> 	<li>For <strong>asset owners or managers</strong>, the ICP approach will provide transparency of the process and will give them the confidence in implementing the measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>For the <strong>project developer</strong>, ICP provides a process that is understood and accepted by all participants. This will reduce transaction costs and should minimise any misunderstandings.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li> 	<li>For the <strong>financial community</strong>, the ICP approach standardises the project development process and bring the necessary confidence to undertake the investments.&nbsp; Importantly, ICP Europe Investor Network is comprised of energy efficiency investors who recognise the benefit of industry best practice and standardised energy renovation project delivery. &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<p>One of the major barriers identified in investing in energy efficiency is the<strong> lack of standardisation of the process.</strong>&nbsp; The process is essentially the interaction between the asset owner/manager and the project developer (an energy service company, an installation or engineer company).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many factors that influence decisions and action. The Investor Confidence Project is there to remove many of the complications and risks in improving your company’s energy performance in improving your company’s energy performance. It ensures that the process of choosing what to do, how to do it and how to finance it is standardised, giving you assurance. It can help senior management better understand energy efficiency from a strategic perspective because it does remove risk.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>ICP brought to Europe to develop a <strong>system to give confidence to all active stakeholders</strong>. There are still concerns that investing in energy efficiency is risky. ICP is designed to change that. ICP started with investments in buildings and is now broadening the scope to include industry, district energy and street lighting through a two-year project funded by the European Commission.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>concept of ICP is relatively simple</strong> to understand. A potential project in a factory or a district heating system, for example, is identified. Someone has to do the necessary calculations to determine the viability. Someone has to be identified to install it (often the same organisation). And some organisation needs to fund it. What this project does is standardise the procedures so that all players gain confidence in the system. The factory owner is happy. The developer/auditor/installer is happy. The financial institution is happy. There are protocols in place and third party monitoring to ensure everything is done correctly. The protocols are developed by interested experts and not by commercial interests.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why we need ICP training &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The <strong>Protocols are quite technical and designed to assist the project process</strong>. The ICP Training System combines the use of the ICP Protocols and independent third party verification to create Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ (IREE™) projects that provide investors and asset owners with a new level of confidence in project engineering, performance and returns. &nbsp;</p>
<p>ICP Project Developers (PDs) have to be trained by ICP, their qualifications and experience have to be vetted and are the only ones that can develop an IREE™ project and be a member of the ICP Project Developer Network. PDs can be ESCOs, engineering firms, facility managers, asset owners, or others that develop project proposals.

<h3>Final words &nbsp;</h3>

<p>The ICP approach for industry is new.&nbsp; It has a good track record for use in buildings but it is now to be tested for the industrial sector.&nbsp; Even if you are not completely convinced about this approach, take the initial two hours’ training and see for yourself that it forms a <strong>good basis for standardising the relationship between the asset owner, the project developer and the investment community</strong>. &nbsp;</p>

1144,"Does VR work for Energy Efficiency markets? A review of the VR presentation of the Investor Confidence Project at Hannover Messe 2018",NULL,NULL,"<h3>Experiences from using Virtual Reality in B2B communication</h3>
<p><a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www2.ee-ip.org/content/show/energy-transition-goes-virtual/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">(download full review of our HM VR event on the Investor Confidence Project ICP <strong>here</strong>)</a></p>
<p>We are exploring Virtual Reality and its application for B2B and B2P (""business to policy"") communication since 2016. Our intention was and is to identify and develop new ways of attracting and engaging with EEIPs target audiences. Virtual Reality offers many possible benefits: from new user experiences to new forms of collaboration and information to awareness creation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But 2016 we were not convinced that the technology is mature enough. This has changed...</p>
<h3>The challenge: Investor Confindence Project ICP</h3>
<p>EEIP is partner in the EU funded H2020 project ICP. ICP aims to better connect financial markets with energy efficiency sector in Europe to enable better access to finance for project developers and finally to more energy efficiency projects implemented.</p>
<p>The idea behind is rather simple: reduce the uncertainty of project outcomes and make projects bankable.</p>
<p>The approach is build on what financial markets call the ""DNA"" of business: Standards. ICP has developed certifiable and technology neutral project process standards and supports project developers (and investors) with training and project assistance in the implementation.</p>
<p>And ICP is supported by a global network of industrial allies as well as an investor network ready to invest more than a billion EUR.</p>
<p>And the challenge?</p>
<p>Even though the arguments are convincing, reaching target groups with such a rather dry and technical subject is always more difficult than many expect. Constant overflow of information and daily business pressure are the enemies - making it hard to grap the attention of project developers for 30min enough to explain the basics and benefits of the new approach. Once this has been achieved,&nbsp; ICP can convince many stakeholders to take the effort to participate in a training and to apply the ICP protocols - but many of you know how difficult it is to get 30min attention for a new subject, especially if this is the first contact!</p>

<p>We have used a Virtual Reality environment from a company called Hyperfair and designed it to our needs. The environment can be accessed via laptop (looks a little bit like a 3D game) but now also via mobileVR using a standard mobile up to full VR including hand controllers, the rather expensive option (still). And it can obviously be accessed from anywhere at the same time.</p>
<p>The idea was to leverage the Hannover Messe, biggest industrial fair globally, to run an ""event in an&nbsp; event"": A physical ""event"" where participants come together - to then use mobileVR headsets to jointly experience the ICP presentation in VR. This has also allowed others not having a mobileVR headset to follow the presentation on the ""real screen"" to which we streamed the VR event. In other words, we ran the event in VR, but people ""outside"" could see the presentation and the VR participants (or their avatars) from the outside.</p>

<h3>The Results</h3>

<p>The results were astonishing. We were very convinced that it would turn out being a success, but results were even better than expected. With a primarily online based announcement marketing communication, we reached more than 100.000 - with this topic..., not covering visibility generated through 3rd parties talking about it and articles such as newsletters from the Hannover Messe itself.</p>
<p>We had also more positive feedback and follow up discussions than we could manage. And more interest generated compared to many month of communications before.</p>

<p>Recently I published an article on&nbsp; my personal website about a study in Canada that shows the potential for greenhouse gas emissions by small and medium-sized enterprises. I entitled the post <strong><a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://energyindemand.com/2018/03/17/a-leading-solution-may-be-hidden-in-plain-sight/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">“A leading solution may be hidden in plain sight”</a></strong>.&nbsp; The article was a wake up call to me because these SMEs are so key to our economies and yet there is so much untapped potential to play a bigger role in our low-carbon energy transition.</p>
<p>This reminded me of the <a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/Final%20Report%20EEFIG%20v%209.1%2024022015%20clean%20FINAL%20sent.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>study</strong></a> published in 2015 from the<strong> <a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.eefig.com/index.php"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group</a></strong>&nbsp;(EEIP is a member of EEFIG) that had the following comment on SMEs:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the EU there are 22 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which provide around 89 million jobs and represent 99% of all enterprises but seldom have the capacity to systematically exploit energy savings. While absolute energy use per firm in SMEs (industrial and non-industrial), and non-energy intense companies, is lower than in large, energy-intensive industrial companies, focusing on energy end-use efficiency in SMEs and in large, non-energy intensive companies is often very cost effective. Eurochambers estimates a short-term 10-20% “win-win” energy reduction potential among its 20 million EU members. SMEs may have not implemented even basic measures as they may not have sufficient management time, capability or dedicated expertise to do so and therefore the market share of low cost potential for energy savings in SMEs is particularly high, (<em>Energy Efficiency – the first fuel for the EU Economy</em>,&nbsp;EEFIG, February 2015, p. 38).</p></blockquote>

<h3>The challenge</h3>

<p>While this is a call for SMEs to take energy efficiency improvements more seriously, we understand the pressures they are under just to survive in a competitive marketplace.&nbsp; So, how do we start seriously addressing the potential, in our case, for improved energy efficiency?</p>
<p>With many awareness efforts over the decades, we have yet to succeed to tap into much of that potential. So, let’s try a different approach</p>
<p>What we need are financial institutions, project developers, technology and service providers as well as energy agencies at all levels to increase their initiatives to promote improved energy efficiency in SMEs through their own channels.</p>
<p>We would like to draw your attention to one “de-risking” tool that is being developed for industry, district energy and street lighting, after having successfully started for buildings.&nbsp; This is the <a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://eeip.webseiten.cc/ http://europe.eeperformance.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>Investor Confidence Project's</strong></a> Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™&nbsp;(IREE™). This essentially sets a framework between the asset owner (in this case the SME), the project developer and the financial institution.</p>

<p>This gap in the relationship between the three main stakeholders is real. What ICP does is provide a platform for these stakeholders to interact and gain confidence in each other.&nbsp; The SME can better understand the potential in its own facilities without the anxiousness.</p>
<p>The project developer can take advantage of this standardised approach even if he or she is using instruments such as energy performance contracting. We are completing the preparation of protocols that are used in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The financial investor gains confidence in the entire process. This will undoubtedly lead to more supporting of energy conservation measures.</p>
<h3>How you can be part of the Investor Confidence Project solution?</h3>
<p>I have written extensively about the Investor Confidence Project and you can find out more by reading our <a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/articles/detailed/d296929403a5c5c3aae5852e9fbc924c/faq-how-the-icp-process-works-for-industry-district-energy-and-street-lighting/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></a>&nbsp;.</p>
<h3>What it takes for you to be part of the solution?</h3>

<ul> 	<li>First, we need financial institutions to join our Investor Network. Already we have many in the <a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/investors.html#!directory"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>network</strong></a>, but for full market roll out we need more.</li> 	<li>Second, we need project developers – ESCOs and others – to take our training and become part of our network so that they can use our methodology. To date we have had two initial trainings for industry and for street lighting. See our dedicated page <a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/project-developers.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>here</strong></a>.</li> </ul>

<h3>Where we are now</h3>
<p>Protocols have been developed for complex and targeted industrial energy efficiency projects. There are available <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www2.ee-ip.org/content/CompanyPage/show/i3cp-europe-street-lighting/file/388_ICP_Street_Lighting_Protocol"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>here</strong></a>. Either could be used for SMEs, depending on the level of ambition.&nbsp;The first training for project developers took place late April and the training is<strong> <a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/trainings-recordings.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">available on-line</a></strong>. What it takes to be part of our Project Development Network is available <a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/industry-pd-network.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<ul> 	<li>ICP Europe is now looking for potential pilot projects to test the approach.</li> 	<li>ICP Europe is also looking for more members of the Investors Network.</li> 	<li>Most SMEs need our help. Project developers play a key role in helping SMEs understand the potential for energy efficiency improvements and to undertake the necessary energy conservation measures.</li> </ul>
<p>Technical assistance is available for the pilot projects from ICP Europe.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of the 1971 song by Carole King, <em>You’ve Got a Friend</em>. Remember, we all need a friend. <a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAR_Ff5A8Rk"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>There you are</strong></a>.</p>

Have you considered adopting solar as a source of power for your home or business?</p>
<p>If you answered “yes” you’re in good company. According to a recent report from the International Energy Agency, electricity generated from the sun is the fastest growing source of energy in the world.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>“Solar power was the fastest-growing source of new energy worldwide last year, outstripping the growth in all other forms of power generation for the first time”&nbsp;</em><a data-href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/04/solar-power-renewables-international-energy-agency"" href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/04/solar-power-renewables-international-energy-agency"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Guardian</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Free, renewable and clean are some of the most compelling benefits for converting to solar-powered energy instead of traditional fossil fuel-sourced energy. While those benefits are just some of the factors driving a surge in solar installations, there are many hidden benefits that merit attention.</p>
<p>The hidden benefits of solar sourced energy were clearly spelled out in a recent report by the&nbsp;<a data-href=""https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/371a41_1838db18923e4eb3a48712bbef91fef7.pdf"" href=""https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/371a41_1838db18923e4eb3a48712bbef91fef7.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Institute for Energy Innovation</a>. The report was created in an effort to educate policy makers attempting to manage rapid changes taking place in the power grid. Those changes reflect the move from the historical centralized source of energy generation to a grid that encompases distributed generation (DG).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>“Driven by declines in the cost of solar components, greater competition among solar installers, and growing familiarity with solar DG and its benefits, national solar DG has expanded by more than 50 percent annually over the last four years”&nbsp;</em><a data-href=""https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/371a41_1838db18923e4eb3a48712bbef91fef7.pdf"" href=""https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/371a41_1838db18923e4eb3a48712bbef91fef7.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Institute for Energy Innovation</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The Institute for Energy Innovation’s report is titled&nbsp;Solar Energy in Michigan: The Economic Impact of Distributed Generation on Non-Solar Customers. While the report merits an in-depth review by those involved in the energy industry, the jargon and acronyms make it a bit overwhelming for those already sold on the “free, renewable and clean” aspects of solar powered energy.</p>
<p>The list below is an attempt to convey the report’s valuable information (without jargon or acronyms) detailing the many hidden benefits of solar:</p>
<ol> 	<li><strong>Improved Reliability?</strong>—When Hurricanes Irma and Maria destroyed the power lines on the island of Puerto Rico the vulnerability of a centralized grid was graphic. One&nbsp;<a data-href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-solar/how-solar-energy-saved-a-puerto-rican-farm-from-hurricane-maria-idUSKCN1C90CG"" href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-solar/how-solar-energy-saved-a-puerto-rican-farm-from-hurricane-maria-idUSKCN1C90CG"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">story</a>&nbsp;from the island clearly illustrates the improved reliability associated with generating energy at distributed or on-site locations:&nbsp;<em>“While his competitors wait for diesel to restart generators knocked out by Hurricane Maria, flower grower Hector Santiago is already back in business because of solar panels powering his 40-acre nursery in central Puerto Rico.”</em></li> 	<li><strong>Reduced Demand?</strong>—Facilities or homes generating all or most of their electricity on location will use less energy from the grid. Any reduction in overall grid demand for electricity results in a reduced need for building additional expensive power generating plants.</li> 	<li><strong>Less Wasted Energy?</strong>—When electricity is transmitted along power lines there is loss that naturally occurs. The greater the distance from the source, the greater the loss. Think of it as attempting to water a garden using a garden hose with holes in it. The amount available at the end is less than the amount produced at the source. The&nbsp;<a data-href=""https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=105&amp;t=3"" href=""https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=105&amp;t=3"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">U.S. Government</a>&nbsp;estimates 5% of the energy generated for the national grid is lost during transmission. When electricity it generated on-site the waste is kept to a minimum. Less waste equals lower cost of electricity.</li> 	<li><strong>Improved Resilience?</strong>—Resilience is the ability to recover quickly. Imagine being told it will take&nbsp;<a data-href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/09/28/storm-driven-power-failures-in-the-caribbean-spur-new-interest-in-renewable-energy/?utm_source=rss_energy-environment&amp;utm_term=.92331ec79280"" href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/09/28/storm-driven-power-failures-in-the-caribbean-spur-new-interest-in-renewable-energy/?utm_source=rss_energy-environment&amp;utm_term=.92331ec79280"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">four to six months</a>&nbsp;before electricity is restored after a storm! When energy is produced in “distributed” locations, instead of at a single source, there is less vulnerability and an increased capacity to recover quickly.</li> 	<li><strong>Predictable Energy Costs?</strong>—Electricity generated from burning fuel (oil, gas, coal) reflects a cost related to the price of the fuel. If fuel prices increase the&nbsp;<a data-href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemmagreen/2017/10/04/how-blockchain-will-take-fossil-energy-by-storm/#1f7e8af9288d"" href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemmagreen/2017/10/04/how-blockchain-will-take-fossil-energy-by-storm/#1f7e8af9288d"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">cost&nbsp;</a>of electricity has to rise. Because solar does not require fuel, the resultant cost of the electricity is not subject to fluctuations and the resultant cost of energy is predictable throughout the life cycle of the equipment.</li> 	<li><strong>Clean and Quiet Communities?</strong>—Because the operation of generating electricity from the sun doesn’t create smoke or use noisy machinery, the choice for solar is a proven advantage for communities concerned about health.</li> 	<li><strong>Clean Jobs?</strong>—Solar is driving a dramatic growth in “<a data-href=""http://energyalliancegroup.org/the-hot-new-job-market-green-collar-workers/"" href=""http://energyalliancegroup.org/the-hot-new-job-market-green-collar-workers/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">green collar</a>” jobs. These jobs require advanced skills and offer a premium wage due to their technical nature.

<p>To paraphrase one of the conclusions from the Institute for Energy Innovation’s report, the growth in distributed energy, represented by multiple solar generating installations attached to the electrical grid, helps reduce the overall costs and risks of centralized energy production and distribution. It represents an overall net benefit to society.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>“The growth of solar DG systems in most cases helps to reduce overall costs and represents a net benefit to all utility customers.”&nbsp;</em><a data-href=""https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/371a41_1838db18923e4eb3a48712bbef91fef7.pdf"" href=""https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/371a41_1838db18923e4eb3a48712bbef91fef7.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Institute for Energy Innovation</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>When the many benefits of solar powered energy are clearly understood, it should encourage both private and public decision makers to do everything possible to promote the adoption of solar. Even without an understanding of all the benefits of solar, a rising demand coupled with plummeting costs makes solar energy one of the preferred sources of generated energy today and into the future.</p>

1147,"What’s next for industrial energy efficiency?",NULL,NULL,"
<p>From Paul Noble, DNV GL, first published&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://blogs.dnvgl.com/energy/whats-next-for-industrial-energy-efficiency"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a>.</p>
<p>There has been a great deal of thought about how industrial companies can keep delivering improved energy efficiency. And many companies have made great progress. But the question remains, if improving energy efficiency reduces operational costs, why don't companies do more?</p>
<p>The 'usual' reasons cited are lack of capex and resources, poor payback, the need to focus on other priorities such as production and quality, and a resistance to change and complexity.</p>
<p>However, rapid change is underway. For example, more organisations are engaging in a holistic approach to their energy and carbon strategy. By evaluating energy efficiency programmes, on-site renewable potential, storage and electricity market opportunities (e.g., demand side response, ancillary services), organisations can minimise cost, carbon emissions and exposure to volatile energy markets in parallel with improving sustainability performance and capturing additional revenue sources.</p>
<p>Key UK Government policies are now anchored by the industrial strategy and include ESOS (Phase 2 deadline is December 2019), CCAs, CCL and CRC. A consultation on streamlining Energy and Carbon Reporting took place in 2017 with the government's response expected shortly.</p>
<p>According to the UK government:</p>
<ul> 	<li>There is <strong>insufficient awareness</strong>, notably at senior management level, of energy costs and cost saving opportunities that exist across whole businesses.</li> 	<li>There is <strong>significant potential</strong> for UK businesses to save money, estimated at over £2 billion per year, through improved energy efficiency in buildings and processes (less than 7 year paybacks - <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/565748/BEES_overarching_report_FINAL.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">Building Energy Efficiency Survey and BEIS analysis).</a></li> </ul>
<p>The consultation explained that the government is considering how to drive further company action, for example, by <strong>mandating</strong> that companies above a certain size threshold report not just on potential energy efficiency saving opportunities - as is currently the case for ESOS - but also actions taken. In addition, the government is considering extending the reporting of energy and intensity metrics and increasing the frequency to annual reporting (aligning with company annual reports and Greenhouse Gas reporting).</p>
<p>So, there is likely to be more pressure for companies to develop and report on progress made with their energy efficiency plans.</p>
<h3><strong>What are the opportunities?</strong></h3>
<p>A range of solutions are available which interact with energy/utility, engineering, production and maintenance teams.</p>
<p>Working at the interface of manufacturing production, energy supply and utilities and energy consumption, companies can use the following measures to deliver significant energy savings:</p>
<ul> 	<li>An Energy Management System, if correctly implemented and actively used, will enable companies to tap into their full energy savings potential. For example, visualising energy management performance through a focused approach that monitors and measures progress against targets, will enable continuous improvement.</li> 	<li>Energy audits offer a streamlined and cost-effective way to reach compliance with legislation and identify savings in energy consumption - 7% on average.</li> 	<li>Data variability analysis (or data analytics) - leading companies are increasingly harnessing the power of 'big data' to understand longer term trends in energy consumption metrics, which can identify harder-to-reach' energy savings.</li> 	<li>Energy culture - working with production, engineering and maintenance teams to assess and deliver energy savings through changes to behaviours - savings can range from 5-15%.</li> </ul>
<p>In summary, energy use and carbon emissions from industrial processes will receive increasing attention from regulators, investors, supply chains and consumers. Companies need to continue to deliver incremental energy efficiency improvements as part of longer term strategic energy plans that will deliver low carbon energy supply, purchase and use.</p>

1148,"IoT - Equipped LED lighting systems enhance Energy Efficiency",NULL,NULL,"<p>From Jayne Keynes, first published <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://energyalliancegroup.org/iot-equipped-led-lighting-systems-enhance-energy-efficiency/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a></p>
<p>There are plenty of compelling reasons why US buildings need to switch to LED lighting systems and use the IoT for lighting and illumination. The prevailing benefit of LEDs is that they are far cheaper and last longer compared to traditional lights. LEDs consume 25-30% less energy than halogen incandescents and last 25 times longer according to the Department of Energy. And in businesses and structures that need a lot of power for lighting, the switch can make a significant dent in a company's power bills. The Internet also enables operators to synchronize lighting needs, generate data on how a space is used, communicate with customers to provide information, improve security and even integrate health aspects. Above all, it is a specific or<strong> <a data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://energyalliancegroup.org/the-1000-best-practices-for-sustainable-development/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1527832107207000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFwiAg1tTGdzhXZGD6-y1gWP9Z98Q"" href=""http://energyalliancegroup.org/the-1000-best-practices-for-sustainable-development/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">targeted action that's in line with sustainable development</a></strong> and energy management initiatives.</p>
<h3>Energy efficiency saves money</h3>
<p><a data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://grealpha.com/resources/load-wiring-calculator/calc/voltage-drop/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1527832107207000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF08Vj74xex31O-9UeN_aXTEHDsnw"" href=""https://grealpha.com/resources/load-wiring-calculator/calc/voltage-drop/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>LED lighting systems have the economic potential</strong></a> to generate significant savings to users whether it's a residential house, an office or a commercial warehouse. With the average household spending about 5% of its budget to lighting, switching to LEDs that use 75% less energy compared to incandescent bulbs translates to higher savings. The<strong> <a data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/reports/2012/lighting/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1527832107207000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF8T9oLNDh2FWGCBX2cOHzTxQZmSA"" href=""https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/reports/2012/lighting/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">latest Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS)</a></strong> stated that lights consume 17% of all electricity in commercial buildings in 2012 down from 38% in 2003. Thus, it makes sense to increase its efficiency and manage its consumption. Simple actions such as switching off lights when not in use and posting reminders &amp; stickers can pay dividends. Occupancy sensors can help as well as having a built-in automation system. Replacing existing office lights with LEDs is a smart move that would improve energy efficiency equating to lower expenditures and higher savings.</p>
<h3>The Internet enhances power and budget management</h3>
<p>The internet has endless applications from data generation to monitoring and evaluation. Lighting systems connected to the Internet of Things is valuable in gathering, processing and disseminating information that would improve energy consumption and its efficient management. Efficient power management is not the only benefit of the IoT. It also helps in improving weak areas of lighting in offices and commercial structures thereby introducing effective strategies to improve illumination in spaces, enhance security and increase productivity. <a data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.ledsmagazine.com/articles/2018/01/latest-gooee-partnership-shows-the-iot-is-for-designers-too.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1527832107207000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRXGP1M8kwWO8d2zTVG3KXdQ7n6g"" href=""http://www.ledsmagazine.com/articles/2018/01/latest-gooee-partnership-shows-the-iot-is-for-designers-too.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>The IoT involves different personnel</strong></a> from engineers and designers to installers and communications specialists and the orchestration of their actions is vital to the success of lighting systems.</p>
<p>Linking LED lighting systems with the IoT provides tremendous opportunities for power saving and budget management. Cutting energy consumption is an action that benefits offices and commercial buildings. There are even tax credits that can be availed of that will lower operating costs further with an even bigger benefit that switching to LEDs also reduces greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

1149,"The Gordian Knot of energy efficiency: A message to Europe's financial community",NULL,NULL,"
<p>The Gordian knot is a knot that gave its</p>
<p>name to a proverbial term for a problem solvable only by bold action. In 333</p>
<p>BC, Alexander the Great, on his march through Anatolia, reached Gordium, the</p>
<p>capital of Phrygia. As the Encyclopaedia Britannica states, “In the popular</p>
<p>account, probably invented as appropriate to an impetuous warrior, Alexander</p>
<p>sliced through the knot with his sword, but, in earlier versions, he found the</p>
<p>ends either by cutting into the knot or by drawing out the pole. The phrase</p>
<p>“cutting the Gordian knot” has thus come to denote a bold solution to a</p>
<p>complicated problem.”</p>



<p>The key point is bold action. We are no</p>
<p>longer in 333 BC. One could say we are in the dawn of the low-carbon energy</p>
<p>transition. But we have a problem, many</p>
<p>intertwined problems that need bold action.</p>


<h3>Paving the way</h3>

<p>I have been heading the work on financing</p>
<p>for Energy Efficiency for Industrial Processes (EEIP) since 2011 when we</p>
<p>started with a roundtable exchange of expertise and ideas between the broad</p>
<p>range of stakeholders from businesses, investment funds, banks, ESCOs, with</p>
<p>European decision and policy-makers. Since then, EEIP has used its social network</p>
<p>platforms to maintain a dialogue and help disseminate best practice.</p>



<p>EEIP is an active member of the Energy</p>
<p>Efficiency Financial Institutions Group and was proud to be part of the first</p>
<p>major report in 2015.&nbsp; Since then,</p>
<p>interest in financial issues relating to energy efficiency has grown in Europe</p>
<p>but the Gordian knot has remained.</p>



<p>In 2017, EEIP became a partner in the</p>
<p><strong><a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Investor Confidence Project</a></strong>, funded</p>
<p>by Horizon 2020, that expanded to cover industry, district energy and street</p>
<p>lighting. The Investor Confidence Project Europe unlocks access to financing by</p>
<p>standardising how energy efficiency projects are developed, documented and</p>
<p>measured. It was a simple decision to join because EEIP realised that there had</p>
<p>to be new ways of addressing the Gordian knot. ICP Europe does provide a bold solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it is not a simple solution at the moment because many elements have</p>
<p>to be put in place:</p>

<ul> 	<li>The range of stakeholders need to be made aware of the approach.</li> 	<li>Protocols need to be developed with the support of stakeholders.</li> 	<li>Project developers need to be credentialed.</li> 	<li>A quality assurance network needs to be in place.</li> 	<li>Asset owners need to be convinced.</li> 	<li>The financial community needs to be assured that a properly certified project (the Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ (IREE™) international certification) is worth financing.</li> </ul>


<p>This approach, that is taking time to be</p>
<p>put in place, will reduce many of the concerns that the financial community has</p>
<p>raised over the years. There is a</p>
<p>standardisation of the project development process, not of the technologies.</p>
<p>There is, as the title of the project states, more confidence for investors.</p>


<h3>The bold solution also needs endorsement</h3>

<p>ICP Europe’s Investor Network offers</p>
<p>investors a means to promote ICP Europe while extending brand awareness and</p>
<p>connecting with project originators and programme partners. The core feature</p>
<p>and requirement of the programme is the Investor Network endorsement. This endorsement consists of agreeing to</p>
<p>formally recommend the use of the ICP Europe Protocols and Credentialing System</p>
<p>as best practices for originating energy efficiency projects. As an Investor Network member, organisations</p>
<p>consent to the use of the member’s logo and name in the ICP Europe Investor</p>
<p>Network page on europe.eeperformance.org.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also highly encouraged that participating organisations display</p>
<p>the Investor Network logo and declaration on participant’s website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is an opportunity to be part of the</p>
<p>solution. Bold action is needed address</p>
<p>a complicated problem. We all know that more energy efficiency measures need to</p>
<p>be implemented. That takes financing.</p>


<p>The Gordian knot awaits.</p>

<h3><strong>Why is monitoring good for you?</strong></h3>
<p>Presently, the industry self-monitors and reports through various software controls dashboards. More often than not, there are as many as four different entities involved in the design, build, installation, and operation of energy storage system. The battery cell manufacturer is often also the battery module manufacturer which includes a battery management system (BMS) that reports data up to the system level. The system data and controls are designed by the system integrator and make decisions based on available energy within the system along with temperature controls, fire suppression, and other system level activity. The system controls respond to commands from the energy management system (EMS) which may be yet another company that provides software and system controls based on market signals. A fourth party may be the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor which provides ongoing operations and maintenance and may also be the first in line to support performance guarantees. Therefore, the EPC may be dependent on monitoring from the EMS, which is dependent on data from the system, which is dependent on data from the BMS.&nbsp; Because the EPC is usually the entity offering performance guarantees, there is an assumption that the EPC has responsibly estimated their own risk and will manage the supply chain to ensure that the project owner is made whole if a technical fault arises.&nbsp; However, there are challenges with this approach:</p>
<ul> 	<li><strong>What if another party (such as the off-taker) desires to have a record of monitoring data?&nbsp;</strong>For example, in California, it is a requirement for the resource adequacy agreement that four hours of duration be verified with monitoring. Presently, the software (EMS) dashboard is the source of this monitoring.</li> 	<li><strong>What if the provider of the performance guarantees and warranties is also the provider of data?</strong></li> 	<li><strong>How can the integrity and accuracy of the data be assured to avoid conflict of interest?</strong></li> 	<li><strong>What if the project requires monitoring for tax or financial reasons?&nbsp;</strong>In the US, the project may be built with the intent of including storage in the investment tax credit (ITC) and, therefore, the amount of renewable energy input into the battery is critical.</li> </ul>
<h3><a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.dnvgl.com/services/integrated-monitoring-and-performance-reporting-of-energy-storage-systems-113636"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">IMPRESS</a>&nbsp;offers:</h3>
<ul> 	<li>Independent platform that provides performance reporting and predictive analysis</li> 	<li>Direct, simple insight into and graphical presentation of system performance</li> 	<li>Monitoring of interaction between renewables and storage</li> 	<li>Reliable independent data acquisition essential for resolving conflict on the performance with a vendor</li> </ul>
<p>Monitoring would include contractually important items such as verification of efficiency (which directly impacts revenue), availability, energy capacity and/or duration, power, response time, and other contractually important obligations.</p>
<p>There is one last benefit of monitoring. If, at any time during the project, the project may transition ownership (such as at the expiration of a solar-leaseback agreement), monitoring can be used to verify that the project performed as every stated it would, and thus, the data can be useful for renegotiation of the sale price.</p>

1151,"Why we need and take training?",NULL,NULL,"
<p>Last week I took a three-hour training</p>
<p>course. The subject wasn’t important for what I want to say, but I will mention</p>
<p>it later.</p>



<p>In mid July, the Investor Confidence</p>
<p>Project Europe will be holding its second round of training for industry and</p>
<p>for street lighting. Since I write on it regularly, readers will know about the</p>
<p>ICP process. Just to remind you, the concept of the Investor Confidence Project</p>
<p>is simple to understand. The protocols set out requirements for an investment</p>
<p>package to be submitted by a project developer that covers critical stages</p>
<p>throughout the project lifecycle. A third-party Quality Assurance Provider</p>
<p>subsequently reviews this documentation. Compliant projects are awarded the</p>
<p>Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ certification. This process enables</p>
<p>standardised project performance underwriting, leading to better data on</p>
<p>performance, and a more efficient marketplace with less duplicative engineering</p>
<p>and lower transaction costs. The result should be an increase in deal flow and</p>
<p>a more transparent and efficient market.</p>



<p>There are three main parties involved in</p>
<p>the process: the asset owner/manager,</p>
<p>the project developer (often an energy service company or an engineering</p>
<p>company) and the financial institutions that are available to invest. To make</p>
<p>it work, the project developer is key because he/she is normally the link</p>
<p>amongst all three.&nbsp; More importantly, it</p>
<p>is the project developer who holds the golden key: he or she knows about the</p>
<p>ICP protocols and knows how to use them. The project developer can explain it</p>
<p>to the asset owner/manager and can explain how the protocol will form the key</p>
<p>element in their relationship leading to an implemented measure that is</p>
<p>financed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a look at the protocols <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www2.ee-ip.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Training_Industry_ICP.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>here for industry</strong></a>&nbsp;and for <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www2.ee-ip.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Training_StreetLighting_ICP.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>street lighting here</strong></a>. They are bewildering when first looked at but after second look, they start to make sense. For this reason, ICP requires training that leads to being credentialed under the ICP system. The training is straightforward but it simply is required.</p>

<h3>Upcoming ICP training for industry and for street lighting</h3>
<p>On July 17, at 10 am – 12 am CEST there is online Training on<strong> ICP INDUSTRY Protocols</strong>. In order to become an ICP Project Developer or ICP Quality Assurance Assessor, you need to meet certain requirement. Following this 2h online training course, we will add you to the ICP project developer network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can register <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/1767422452113073921"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>here</strong></a></p>
<p>On July 18, at 10 am – 12 am CEST there is online Training on<strong> ICP Street Lighting Protocol</strong>.

<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>To be a success in the market place, ICP needs to build its foundation – you. There is a need for more project developers so that asset owners can feel more comfortable. There is need for a critical mass of trained and credentialed project developers to make the system work. The benefits are that, once fully in place in your country and throughout Europe, this will lead to more work. The whole purpose is to get more investment in energy conservation measures to meet many of our economic and social objectives. And also to meet your own corporate or individual objectives: reducing costs, improving competitiveness, providing health benefits, and much more ICP is but one way but it is an important step.</p>
<p>So, please consider taking the July training.&nbsp; There will be more opportunities in the upcoming months, but the sooner you do, the better.</p>
<h3>What training brought to me and what it brings to you</h3>


<p>Let’s get back to the training I just undertook.&nbsp;There were eight steps to better performance as expressed by&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://thehelenastridsingingacademy.com/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>Helen Astrid</strong></a>:</p>

<ul> 	<li>No feelings of fear</li> 	<li>Ability to regulate anxiety doing the activity</li> 	<li>Maintain positive thoughts</li> 	<li>High, unshakeable confidence</li> 	<li>Ability to remain focussed without distraction</li> 	<li>Determination to succeed</li> 	<li>Thinking is committed and disciplined</li> 	<li>There is control over the performance</li> </ul>

<p>This was for me singing on stage, finding my voice, so that I could communicate. This is what training can bring. Now, it will be slightly different for you in the ICP training but, when you think about it, what you are looking for will really not be that much different.</p>
<p>What we need is your voice. You will be the interlocutor with the asset owner/manager, not us. We can set the scene. We can create some awareness. We can make sure you are prepared. But we cannot sit in the room with you as you explain the importance of the Protocol as key to the relationship you establish.</p>
<p><strong>Your voice now needs to be in the right key! And it will. So, register now for the training!</strong></p>

1152,"Blockchain in the energy sector is moving forward - Key takeaways from the EventHorizon 2018",NULL,NULL,"<p>First published <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.enerquire.com/blog/blockchain-in-the-energy-sector-insights-from-the-eventhorizon18-the-first-day"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a></p>
<p>A decommissioned power plant in Berlin finally was brim-full of energy again when experts of the energy and blockchain sector entered the stage at the Event Horizon 2018. “Flip the switch” was the motto of the conference, which very well summarizes the vibe at the event: It is time to move forward: from concepts to application and demonstration.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Europe becomes the headquarter of energy-related blockchain initiatives</h3>

<p>In his key note, Jules Besnaunou, the current director of the Cleantech Group, provided some interesting insights into the latest blockchain-related topics that move the energy industry and will be summed up for you right here:</p>
<p>While in 2016, energy-related blockchain initiatives could mostly be found in the US, in 2017, Europe is the key player in this realm by far. First, let us take a look back at 2016. Figure 1 shows the number of startups that were working on energy-related blockchain solutions in 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""391"" height=""422"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/ca88df7f83.png"" width=""750"" style="""" /></p>

<table summary=""""> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""> 			<p>&nbsp;</p> 			</th> 		</tr> 	</thead> </table>
<p><em>Figure 1: CleanTech Group - Investments in blockchain startups worldwide 2016 (CleanTech Group 2017)</em></p>
<p>In 2016, investment in blockchain startups in the energy realm was five times larger in the US than in Europe, even though the number of startups in the US was only 50% above the total number in Europe. This has changed significantly as we can see in figure 2.</p>



<p><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""392"" height=""350"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/49a0623df4.jpg"" width=""750"" style="""" /></p>

<p><em>Figure 2:&nbsp;CleanTech Group 2018 - investments in energy blockchain startups (Jules Besnaunou @EH18)</em></p>
<p>Today, investments in Europe are more than five times as high as those in the US. The total number of blockchain startups focusing on the energy sector has increased from 15 in 2016 to 70 by the end of 2017. In the US, however, only 16 new companies have entered the field of energy blockchain in 2017. Therefore, China is now the second largest market for energy-focused blockchain initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>From ICOs to classical funding rounds and venture capital</h3>
<p>Corresponding to the overall trend, ICOs were the main funding source for energy-related blockchain startups in 2017. However, according to Jules Besnaunou, this is likely to change in the second part of 2018. From then on, traditional finance rounds will become the dominant instrument to support the existing initiatives, and Venture Capital Investments will occur more frequently. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Regulation, dApps, the Energy Web Chain and state channels</h3>
<p>Besides the key note of Jules Besnaunou there were plenty of interesting presentations and discussion that provided very detailed insights into the current state of blockchain applications in the energy sector. In the following, we summarize some of the most interesting insights that we gather in some sessions. Note that due to the parallel structure of the event we weren’t able to catch all news and insights from the event. Therefore, this is just a collection of some relevant developments that were presented at the EventHorizon 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The energy regulator in Chile is making the first step to use smart contracts</h3>
<p>While most regulators worldwide have only started to understand the implications of blockchain technology for the energy sector, the regulators in Chile take a more progressive approach. In March 2018, Chile’s National Energy Commission (CNE) started to use Ethereum-based smart contracts to verify data related to marginal costs, fuel prices, compliance with the renewable energy law, and average market prices. The data will become available via the Open Energy Platform of CNE. Thereby, CNE became one of the first public bodies worldwide that implemented smart contracts in the energy realm.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Energy Web Foundation presented the first two dApps that are running on the Energy Web Chain</h3>
<p>The Energy Web Foundation (EWF) together with Grid Singularity were the two main organizers of the EventHorizon 2018. The EWF announced several key features of the Energy Web Chain at the conference, e.g. the Proof-of-Authority approach. More details about the EWF’s announcements can be found on their own&nbsp;<a href=""https://energyweb.org/2018/04/17/energy-web-foundation-unveils-major-blockchain-milestones-at-event-horizon/""><strong>blog</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, we want to briefly introduce two dApps that have been developed by the EWF-consortium and that illustrate the potential of the Energy Web Chain for the energy sector.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>D3A – a basis for a new market design of the energy sector is taking shape</h3>
<p>For now, the Decentralized Autonomous Area Agent (D3A) stands for a concept to develop a tool-box that allows to translate current energy market design into the Energy Web Chain. Currently D3A consists of an agent-based model to simulate what a blockchain-based market design could look like. For now, D3A has the capability to simulate in what ways remote mini-grids could be operated based on the Energy Web Chain. It provides the framework to define different energy-only markets that optimize the exchange of electricity between producers and consumers on a decentralized level. Within the next steps, different scenarios beyond micro-grids including locational marginal pricing will be included in the simulation. After successful simulations the D3A framework will be deployed in the blockchain environment of the Energy Web Foundation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3:&nbsp;The Fractal, Recursive D3A Implementation (EWF 2018)</p>
<p>While D3A is currently “only” a simulation, it already gives an idea of the significant potential of the D3A market model and the dApps based on this model that are yet to be released. Especially the chance to develop a market-design that facilitates decentralized optimization and at the same time offers the potential to introduce Locational-Marginal-Pricing, seems to be very promising. For more details about D3A you can read the more detailed paper of the EWF&nbsp;<a href=""https://energyweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/EWF-D3A-ConceptBrief-FINAL201804.pdf""><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<h3>Origin dApp – renewable energy certification on the Energy Web blockchain</h3>

<p>Furthermore, the EWF announced the publication of the Origin dApp. Origin provides a method based on the Energy Web Chain to certify and track renewable energy generation on the kWh level, including marginal grid CO2 emissions. Thereby, the Origin dApp provides the basis to trade renewable energy certificates via the Energy Web blockchain. Importantly, the Origin dApp was developed to be compatible with existing certification systems and regulations to allow a smooth transformation from existing systems towards a blockchain-based solution. More details about the Origin dApp can be accessed&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://energyweb.org/origin/"">here</a>&nbsp;</strong>or in the video below.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Throughput and scalability are challenges, but the solutions are already there</h3>
<p>In the public discussion, throughput (transactions per second in case of trading, stuff-per-second in general) and scalability are among the most discussed challenges for the diffusion of blockchain technology. While these concerns are valid and need much attention, there already exist several solutions to this problem. One of them was discussed in a deep dive session with Aeron Buchanan, Co-Founder of Grid Singularity and Advisor of the Web 3 Foundation. Aeron pointed out one specific solution to increase throughput of public blockchains via state channels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the idea of state channels in general terms for the case of repeated transactions between two parties: rather than using the blockchain to process every transaction between two users that transfer value between each other on a regular basis, you can set up a smart contract that allows you to execute transactions of a defined budget bilaterally without involving the blockchain. Instead, the transactions are transferred off-chain between the two involved parties (using any other network than the blockchain the smart contract is running on, e.g. via the internet). Importantly, every involved party keeps track of the transactions made between each other and agrees to each of them. When the defined budget of the smart contract is reached (or even beforehand if the parties wish to do so), they provide the final state of the transactions to the smart contract. Only then the smart contract interacts with the whole blockchain network to communicate the final outcome of the transactions between the two parties involved (e.g. via a list of transactions made). Thereby, most transactions are made off-chain, and only the beginning and final state of the transactions are carried out through the blockchain. A more detailed (and probably more accurate) description of state channels is provided by Josh Stark&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://medium.com/l4-media/making-sense-of-ethereums-layer-2-scaling-solutions-state-channels-plasma-and-truebit-22cb40dcc2f4"">here</a>&nbsp;</strong>on medium.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For BitCoin, the Lightning network has just been published a few weeks ago and a similar solution for the Ethereum blockchain, the Raiden network, should be ready soon. With these solutions, a first step towards increasing throughput in public and permissionless blockchains is made. This takes us one step closer to a blockchain solution for the energy sector as well.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>From concepts to first application in the energy sector</h3>
<p>The EventHorizon 2018 was a spectacular show but at the same time a worthwhile information session on the status quo of blockchain applications for the energy sector. Although there are no solutions market-ready yet, the different initiatives have taken first crucial steps to come closer to real applications. Especially the pitches from more than 40 startups provided some nice examples of what could become possible with the Energy Web Chain. The EWF itself provided first examples of dApps for the energy sector. While the Origin dApp addresses one specific use-case, the D3A-concept has the potential to unlock several use cases in the context of P2P-trading in the energy market, and also Locational Marginal Pricing on the distribution grid level might become feasible. The progress that the energy industry has made within the last 12 months is remarkable and makes us confident that we will see more applications than concepts at the next EventHorizon 2019!</p>

<p>A group of experts has published their suggestions for Europe's energy future in the European Energy Atlas 2018. In this excerpt, European Parliment member Claude Turmes points out that the energy transition will save money and create jobs - if Europe is willing to take action.</p>
<p>100% renewable energy in Europe is viable now<em> (Photo via <a href=""https://www.boell.de/en/european-energy-atlas-2018"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Energy Atlas</a>, CC BY-SA 4.0)</em></p>
<p>Europe is making progress towards its energy transition at a rate few imagined ten years ago. There is still a long way to go, but the continent is now in a position to become the global leader in green energy. It needs to make the right policy choices today to seize this opportunity.</p>
<p>The world's climate is changing faster than ever, and the people of Europe are more and more informed about its dangers. That awareness is being converted into action. Citizens, governments and corporations are realizing that converting to greener forms of energy is not an expensive and painful exercise, but one that brings economic benefits: cost savings, new industries, local jobs that cannot be relocated, and energy security.</p>

<table summary=""""> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col"">&nbsp;</th> 		</tr> 	</thead> </table>
<p><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""394"" height=""482"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/8d600da9e5.png"" width=""658"" style="""" /></p>

<p>Europe is already a world leader in many green technologies, including onshore and offshore wind power. The energy transition offers export opportunities to disseminate this know-how worldwide. Competition from North America and the Far East is pushing Europe to invest further in research and innovation, and to establish conditions where green technologies can flourish. These include a dynamic domestic market that allows the large-scale deployment of renewable energy, a construction sector focusing on ""positive-energy"" buildings (ones that produce more power than they consume), and green transportation. With better interconnections between national power grids and the transport and heating sectors Europe can easily get 100 percent of the energy it needs from renewable sources, thereby reducing our fossil fuel import bill to zero.</p>

<h3>Climate change in the hands of green technologies</h3>
<p>The Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 has shown that the world will only be able to limit climate change if it abandons the use of fossil fuels. Carbon risk is a tangible problem, and investors will gradually pull out of fossil fuels in favour of green technology. The accord has raised awareness about the potential of renewables and the benefits of energy efficiency. Flagship projects are emerging with EU financial support, such as offshore windfarms in the North Sea and Baltic Sea, the conversion of district heating from fossil fuels to renewable energy, and European corridors for electric mobility.</p>
<p>For the past 100 years, geopolitical strength has depended on countries possessing or having access to energy resources. In the future, it will rely on gaining competitive advantage from the best environmental technologies. The countries that advance solar and wind power, smart grids and energy storage will be one step ahead. Reducing their fossil-fuel imports will strengthen their energy security. This is the case for Europe. Accelerating the deployment of green technology will reduce Europe's dependence on countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia and increase its geopolitical clout. But Europe's economy still relies heavily on fossil fuels, mostly for heating, cooling and transportation.</p>
<h3>Transport remains the hardest sector to decarbonize:</h3>
<p>More than 90 percent of vehicles in the EU burn fossil fuels. However, the ""dieselgate"" scandal, where carmakers tried to cheat on official emissions tests, has become a serious setback for diesel engines. The growing awareness of the harm that diesel exhaust does to human lungs is likely to hasten the uptake of electric vehicles. Fewer cars in cities, allocating more space to walking and cycling, and greener public transport can change mobility patterns in cities and trigger cleaner air and better health.</p>
<h3>The energy transition is also a battle for democracy:</h3>
<p>When it comes to making change happen, an all-powerful market cannot be left without any checks and balances. For too long, citizens have been at the mercy of economic and geopolitical interests that are beyond their reach. Empowering people and giving them the right to choose is essential because it is citizens who pick up the bill. The energy transition allows customers to be more than just passive subjects unable to exert influence on decisions. Millions of individuals, cooperatives and local authorities can play a vital role in the energy transition by owning, or co-owning, renewable-energy generation facilities; they can be actively involved by producing their own electricity and employing smart meters to optimize their energy consumption. The pro-climate movement of European local authorities is blooming. Millions of citizens are turning to renewables, individually or by joining cooperatives.</p>
<h3>The transition must go hand-in-hand with:</h3>
<p>New economic perspectives for coal-producing regions. Low prices for carbon on the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme have artificially extended the lifespan of coal- as well as lignite mines and power plants, increasing the economic pain for those regions when the switch finally occurs. Instead of ignoring this, the progressive and firm shutdown of mines and power plants should be coupled with effective planning and management and a 'fair transition' for workers at both the local and regional levels to avoid a major social crisis.</p>
<p>Past EU policies have triggered the energy transition in Europe. Policy decisions made today will define the framework for the next decades. The right choices will determine whether the EU can seize the twin opportunities presented, helping to save the planet from climate catastrophe and making it the world's leader in green technology.</p>

1155,"Glass Industry: 16 Emerging Technologies for Energy-efficiency and GHG Emissions Reduction",NULL,NULL,"
<p>First published <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.globalefficiencyintel.com/new-blog/2018/glass-emerging-technologies-for-energy-emissions"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a></p>
<p>Glass production is a highly energy-intensive industrial process. The container and flat glass industries (which combined account for 80% of glass production) emit over 60 million tonne of CO2 emissions per year. The global increase in glass consumption and production will drive significant growth in the industry’s absolute energy use and GHG emissions.</p>
<p>Studies have documented the potential to save energy by implementing commercially-available energy-efficiency technologies and measures in the glass industry worldwide. However, today, given the projected continuing increase in glass production, future reductions (e.g., by 2030 or 2050) in absolute energy use and GHG emissions will require further innovation in this industry. Innovations will likely include development of different processes and materials for glass production or technologies that can economically capture and store the industry’s GHG emissions. The development of these emerging technologies and their deployment in the market will be a key factor in the glass industry’s mid- and long-term climate change mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>Many studies from around the world have identified sector-specific and cross- energy-efficiency technologies for the glass industry that have already been commercialized. However, information is scarce and scattered regarding emerging or advanced energy-efficiency and low-carbon technologies for the glass industry that have not yet been commercialized.</p>
<p>In 2017, Cecilia Springer of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and I wrote a report that consolidated available information on emerging technologies for the glass industry with the goal of giving engineers, researchers, investors, glass companies, policy makers, and other interested parties easy access to a well-structured database of information on this topic.</p>
<p>The information about the&nbsp;<strong>16 emerging technologies</strong>&nbsp;for the glass industry was covered in the report and was presented using a standard structure for each technology. Table below shows the list of the technologies covered.</p>

<p><em>Table. Emerging energy-efficiency and GHG emissions-reduction technologies for the glass industry (Springer and Hasanbeigi, 2017)</em></p>
<p>Shifting away from conventional processes and products will require a number of developments including: education of producers and consumers; new standards; aggressive research and development to address the issues and barriers confronting emerging technologies; government support and funding for development and deployment of emerging technologies; rules to address the intellectual property issues related to dissemination of new technologies; and financial incentives (e.g. through carbon trading mechanisms) to make emerging low-carbon technologies, which might have a higher initial costs, competitive with the conventional processes and products.</p>

"
1156,"Finding your own energy transition",NULL,NULL,"<p>We are bombarded daily with news about climate change, renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainability, the circular economy, the energy transition, and so on. It is hard to know how much we absorb or how much we simply turn off because of overload.</p>
<p>In our day to day lives, we work. For you with businesses, large or small, there are many things to consider just to keep trading. Over our shoulder we are always trying to stay ahead of our competition — domestic or international. We are always trying to manage our costs.</p>
<p>Yes, we want to be good corporate citizens. We want to do what is good for our community, our country, our world. All of these push us to do more. Yet, there is need for calm but deliberate action.</p>
<h3>What is this energy transition we read about?</h3>
<p>Let us review what the obligations are.</p>
<p>In Europe, there have been an increasing number of commitments to lower our carbon footprint. There are targets for 2020, 2030 and 2050. The 2030 climate and energy framework sets three key targets for the year 2030:</p>
<ul> 	<li>At least 40% cuts in greenhouse gas emissions (from 1990 levels)</li> 	<li>At least 27% share for renewable energy</li> 	<li>At least 27% improvement in energy efficiency</li> </ul>
<p>The framework was adopted by EU leaders in October 2014. It builds on the 2020 climate and energy package. Recently, there have been revisions upwards for both energy efficiency and renewable energy.</p>
<p>The new regulatory framework agreed in June this year includes an energy efficiency target for the EU for 2030 of 32.5% with an upwards revision clause by 2023. Energy ministers also agreed a binding renewable energy target of 32% by 2030.</p>
<p>The EU’s low-carbon economy roadmap suggests that:</p>
<ul> 	<li>By 2050, the EU should cut greenhouse gas emissions to 80% below 1990 levels</li> 	<li>Milestones to achieve this are 40% emissions cuts by 2030 and 60% by 2040</li> 	<li>All sectors need to contribute</li> </ul>
<p>At the 1995 Paris climate conference, there were commitments to:</p>
<ul> 	<li>A long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels;</li> 	<li>To aim to limit the increase to 1.5°C, since this would significantly reduce risks and the impacts of climate change;</li> 	<li>On the need for global emissions to peak as soon as possible, recognising that this will take longer for developing countries;</li> 	<li>To undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with the best available science.</li> </ul>

<h3>What does this mean for you?</h3>
<p>The most important thing you do is take care of your business, ensuring that you remain competitive. That said, it is wise to set up an energy management system. Popular is the standard for the International Standards Organisation (ISO) on energy management (ISO 50001) <strong><a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://eeip.webseiten.cc/[https://www.iso.org/iso-50001-energy-management.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>It specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and improving an energy management system, whose purpose is to enable an organisation to follow a systematic approach in achieving continual improvement of energy performance, including energy efficiency, energy security, energy use and consumption. The standard aims to help organisations continually reduce their energy use, and therefore their energy costs and their greenhouse gas emissions. Importantly, it is useful for organisations of any size — even smaller SMEs.</p>
<p><strong>This is about you and your organisation. This is part of your energy transition.</strong></p>
<p>Through this system or from an energy audit (or both), there will be measures identified for you to undertake. Some will be low cost, some will cost more. So, what do you do? Forget about the national and global targets, you have to ensure you benefit.</p>
<p>The problem is starting . . . But you already have . . .</p>
<h3>How can we help?</h3>
<p>It is well documented that many energy conservation measures are not undertaken because of a lack of standardisation – of the process. Yes, that process is the relationship between the asset owner (the business) and the project developer (often an energy service company or an engineering firm).</p>
<p><strong>There are many factors that influence decisions and action. The Investor Confidence Project is there to remove many of the complications and risks in improving your company’s energy performance in improving your company’s energy performance. It ensures that the process of choosing what to do, how to do it and how to finance it is standardised, giving you assurance. It can help senior management better understand energy efficiency from a strategic perspective because it does remove risk.</strong></p>
<p>ICP brought to Europe to develop a system to <strong>give confidence</strong> to all active stakeholders. There are still concerns that investing in energy efficiency is risky. ICP is designed to change that. ICP started with investments in buildings and is now broadening the scope to include industry, district energy and street lighting through a two-year project funded by the European Commission.</p>
<h3>The concept of ICP is relatively simple to understand:</h3>
<p>A potential project in a factory or a district heating system, for example, is identified. Someone has to do the necessary calculations to determine the viability. Someone has to be identified to install it (often the same organisation). And some organisation needs to fund it. <strong>What this project does is standardise the procedures so that all players gain confidence in the system.</strong>&nbsp;The factory owner is happy. The developer/auditor/installer is happy. The financial institution is happy. There are protocols in place and third party monitoring to ensure everything is done correctly. The protocols are developed by interested experts and not by commercial interests.</p>
<p>The project will work with all of those involved in the project cycle from owners through to project developers and verifiers. They all have a key role to play. To ensure that the protocols are robust, technical forums are being set up to review the draft protocols and provide important technical input to their development.</p>
<ul> 	<li><strong>For asset owners or managers</strong>, the ICP approach will provide transparency of the process and will give them the confidence in implementing the measures.</li> 	<li><strong>For the project developer</strong>, ICP provides a process that is understood and accepted by all participants. This will reduce transaction costs and should minimise any misunderstandings.</li> 	<li><strong>For the financial community</strong>, the ICP approach will standardise the project development process and bring the necessary confidence to undertake the investments.</li> </ul>

<p>Importantly, ICP Europe Investor Network is comprised of energy efficiency investors who recognise the benefit of industry best practice and standardised energy renovation project delivery. Members of the Network support the use of the ICP Protocols and Credentialing System because these systems increase confidence in project performance while reducing due diligence-related transaction costs. ICP Investor Network represents €1.5 billion in energy efficiency project capital.</p>

<p>Last month, there was surprising news from the Korean peninsula. First, Kim Jong-un of North Korea and Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, agreed to have a summit for the first time in ten years. Then shortly after, Kim Jong-un proposed a talk to Trump and Trump accepted it! This is a significant change from last year's nuclear war threats.</p>
<p>But while the world is paying attention to North Korea's nuclear weapons, interesting developments are going on in South Korea's energy sector. However, this side of the Korean Peninsula is not often in international news.</p>

<h3><strong>Energy in South Korea</strong></h3>
<p>In May last year, President Moon was elected after the impeachment of the former president driven by peaceful protests against corruption. Moon pledged to pursue different policies from the previous president in every aspect. <strong>One of his pledges was making South Korea a nuclear-free country and increasing the share of renewable energy to 20% of the energy mix by 2030.</strong></p>
<p>South Korea remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels and nuclear. The electricity mix is currently 40% from coal, 30% from nuclear, 22% from natural gas, and 4% from renewable energy. With 24 reactors in operation,<strong> South Korea has the highest density of nuclear power plants among those countries with more than ten reactors.</strong></p>
<p>The government seemed to have strong political will for a transition away from nuclear energy. The oldest nuclear power plant (Kori 1) was shut down permanently last June. At the ceremony, President Moon made a speech announcing that new nuclear power plant plans will be cancelled; existing nuclear power plants will not have their service lives extended, and old nuclear power plants will be closed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The first step was to stop the construction of two nuclear power plants (Shin-Kori 5 and 6) which were still in their early stages. However, almost one year has passed now and South Korea's energy transition is still being pursued with those two nuclear power plants under construction. What happened?</p>
<h3><strong>Backlash against nuclear phaseout</strong></h3>
<p>Soon after the government stopped the construction, it faced backlash from nuclear scientists and the opposite party. The government suggested forming a citizens' committee on the issue making the process democratic. 471 people who were randomly contacted by phone and decided to join the committee had discussions with experts and stakeholders on both sides. Three months later, in their last session, the committee voted whether to continue the construction of the two nuclear power plants or not. The result was: 59.5% voted for resuming the construction whereas 40.5% against it. The interesting point was that the percentage of support grew higher than the beginning of the committee. Although the majority of the participants agreed to reduce nuclear share in the future, 45% agreed to maintain it or even increase it. The committee therefore recommended the government to resume the construction of nuclear plants, which the government did.</p>
<p><strong>The conclusion of the citizens' committee</strong> can be seen rather shocking to many people, especially in Germany. Many environmental activists in South Korea were also surprised because anti-nuclear movements seemed to have grown stronger after the Fukushima disaster in neighboring Japan.</p>
<p>However, the committee's conclusion implies the particular challenge that South Korea's energy transition has to face. General opinion in Korea supports maintaining the share of nuclear energy in the energy mix even though the president who came into power through massive protests says that he wants South Korea to be a nuclear-free country.</p>
<h3><strong>Why do Koreans support nuclear energy?</strong></h3>
<p>Nuclear energy has been seen for a long time as cheap and efficient energy which will promote Korea's economic growth. Under the Green Growth plan, the Korean government has strategically promoted nuclear by attempting to get contracts to build nuclear power plants in other countries as a way to export Korean technology.</p>
<p>Powerful interest groups have been created in the nuclear industry. Even though the new government is trying to cut itself from the previous government's legacy, it is almost impossible for South Korean major parties to go against the aspiration for economic development. Nuclear technology is regarded as a symbol of achievement. In addition, many people are worried that electricity bills will increase during the energy transition, even though electricity bills in South Korea are relatively cheap.</p>
<p><strong>The Korean government is still strongly pushing for an energy transition.</strong> According to the 8<sup>th </sup>Basic Plan for Electricity Supply and Demand announced last December, South Korea will gradually reduce nuclear share from 30% to 23.9% by 2030. However, the share will remain larger than that of renewable energy (20%).</p>
<p>How long will nuclear energy last in Korea? It is a difficult question both for North as well as South Korea. Hope is there; grassroots renewable energy movements are growing. Environmental awareness has been raised and concerns over nuclear have become bigger. If interest groups in renewable energy gain more power in the energy industry, they can accelerate energy transition in South Korea without nuclear.</p>

<p>Growing up I loved anything to do with the future – particularly the 21st century. TV21 was the comic to read and it was full of stories about life in the 21st century, Thunderbirds, space travel etc.&nbsp; In some respects reality has not lived up to those dreams, although Elon Musk is doing his best to make them come true , but in other ways we already live in a world long described by science fiction – universal communicators for all (mobile phones), and a giant computer that can answer any question (the internet).</p>
<p>When I started to really think about and practice energy management, it was back in the 20th century and it seems as if some of the ways of thinking about energy management remain stuck in the 20th century.&nbsp; Now we are nearly 20% of the way through the 21st century, (hard to believe I know), we need to refresh our thinking and bring energy management into the 21st century.</p>
<p>Let’s consider some aspects of energy management and efficiency and compare 20th century thinking and 21st century thinking.</p>

1159,"Blockchain Technology – a Threat to Distribution Network Operators?",NULL,NULL,"<p>First published <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.enerquire.com/blog/blockchain-technology-a-threat-to-network-operators"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a></p>
<p>Are distribution network operators in Europe threatened by a potential application of blockchain technology in the energy sector? This seems to be the pressing question that was at least partially the motivation for a recent <a href=""https://cdn.eurelectric.org/media/3115/paper1_blockchain_eurelectric-h-CB8D6920.pdf"" target=""_blank"">report</a> on blockchain in the energy sector by eurelectric, which is the European association of the distribution grid operators. From our perspective, this report reads like an attempt by the industry to reassure itself that its core business model – asset ownership and operation of the electricity networks – is not threatened by blockchain.</p>
<h3>Blockchain technology does not jeopardize the need for network operators in general</h3>
<p>In the eurelectric report there is a strong focus on the fact that the monopolistic characteristics of the electricity networks are a kind of showstopper for the application of blockchain technology in the energy sector. To a certain extent the authors of the report have an important point: If we expect blockchain technology to completely eliminate all intermediates in the electricity sector, then the authors are correct to conclude that this is very unlikely to happen, since network ownership will always be performed by a single entity that is regulated to secure that the monopolistic power is not misused by the owner of the networks.</p>
<p>Against the background that blockchain technology pushes disintermediation in many sectors, network operators might feel challenged by this technology (as they probably feel by many digital innovations for that matter). Still, we should keep in mind that blockchain technology does not change the fact that we will need the electricity networks to facilitate the physical exchange of electricity between the different network users. Providing these physical assets to the energy markets will therefore remain an important task, irrespectively of whether digital solutions like blockchain or other technologies will transform the deployment of physical assets. As a result, asset ownership, and here we agree with the conclusion of the authors of the eurelectric report, will remain a regulated task that will be performed by single entities, i.e. the current network operators. However, this discussion is missing an important point, since digital innovations in all network sectors do not threaten the business model that is related to the physical asset ownership: Rather, it is the business models that focus on how these networks are operated that are affected or even challenged by digitalization.</p>
<h3>While network asset ownership won’t be affected much by digitalization, network operation certainly will</h3>
<p>As a consequence, the question remains whether blockchain technology might affect the business model related to network operation. At least from our perspective, this is the much more pressing and difficult question DSOs should ask and think about (we started this discussion in 2017 in this post<a href=""https://www.enerquire.com/blog/blockchain-in-the-energy-sector-the-institutional-side"" target=""_blank""> here</a>). Obviously, there is no clear answer to it yet. Still, let us briefly take a look at what could happen in the future and how the task of network operation might change under the assumption that blockchain technology achieves such a maturity level (which is not impossible from today’s perspective) that it could be applied to network operation as well.</p>
<p>So far, network operation itself does not make use of many market mechanisms, with the exception of balancing markets which are used by transmission grid operators to contract positive or negative balancing power. Still, transmission and distribution grid operators already today make use of different transactions to secure different ancillary services, e.g. direct contractual relations with power plants to provide reactive power, black-start capacity etc. With decentralization, the number of transactions to secure the required volume of ancillary services will increase significantly since many distributed generators and consumers will provide services in the future that are currently centralized with very few conventional power plants. Here, an application of blockchain technology offers the potential to facilitate the verification of transactions that relate to ancillary services and network operation in general.</p>
<p>The way we see it, the main potential of blockchain technology in this context is that it can provide a secure basis for different markets that focus on products for ancillary services and at the same time reduce market entry barriers for smaller devices that are connected to the network. Since electricity networks are a critical infrastructure, there are many different rules and regulations in place to secure that those entities that participate in ancillary services do actually comply with their contractual relations they have with the network operators. Due to these complex regulations, small network users do not provide ancillary services, which they theoretically could. With blockchain technology we could make use of smart contracts to transfer the current regulations and rules for ancillary services to the digital world. Once the smart contracts have been defined properly, they can be used to facilitate market processes to collect ancillary services in a secure and efficient way. In addition, these smart contracts that could facilitate the market processes for ancillary services can be used by all network users – from large industrial consumers down to home appliances – if the network user wants their devices to participate in those markets. This is one of the key capabilities of blockchain technology that is related to network operation: It can provide a secure and efficient basis to collect ancillary services from all network users.</p>
<p>One example for such a blockchain-based concept that could influence how networks are operated in the future is the <a href=""https://energyweb.org/d3a/"">D3A-framework</a> by the Energy Web Foundation (EWF). With D3A the EWF aims at the integration of decentralized assets down to different home appliances into local and national markets for energy and ancillary services as well. Similar projects are currently investigating to what extent smart contracts could be applied to autonomously execute tasks that help to balance the grid, e.g. <a href=""https://medium.com/wepower/wepower-in-partnership-with-elering-is-launching-a-pilot-project-to-tokenize-estonian-energy-7bb929eeed5c"" target=""_blank"">WePower together with the Estonian TSO Elering</a> or <a href=""https://www.tennet.eu/news/detail/europes-first-blockchain-project-to-stabilize-the-power-grid-launches-tennet-and-sonnen-expect-res/"" target=""_blank"">TenneT with the battery storage company Sonnen</a>. Though there are several technological challenges to be addressed before network operation can make use of smart contracts to (partially) reduce network operation to the supervision of different autonomous smart contracts, the potential of this solution seems to be quite significant. If (and this is a big if for now) we suppose that the developers succeed to develop a blockchain system that is capable to perform network operation tasks and that also meets the regulatory and interoperability requirements for the energy sector, then this could have far-reaching implications for the network operators’ business case.</p>
<h3>Long-term risk for DSOs</h3>
<p>Will the current network operators themselves develop the autonomous programs that execute network operation on a blockchain or will these programs be developed by third parties? If the network operators do not develop these solutions, will they still remain the best entity to perform network operation? There is no straightforward answer to these questions since network operation and the related responsibilities are complex. Still, from our perspective, network operators should become an integral part of digital projects that apply blockchains (or other digital technologies) to secure that they will be part of a digitalized energy market in the future.</p>
<p>Though the short-term implications of not being part of the digital transition might be irrelevant to the network operators, there might evolve a long-term risk: Network operation might become an increasingly digitized task which requires capabilities the traditional network operators cannot provide. Then, the government might choose to assign network operation to a different entity that has the capabilities to operate digitalized electricity networks more efficiently. Given this scenario, the current network operators might become pure network asset owners without operational responsibilities since they lag the knowledge to operate and make use of new digital systems.</p>
<p>This is actually a model we already know from the transmission grids in the US where asset ownership is with the utilities, while Independent System Operators (ISO) take care of network operation. While the discussion about ISOs is complex in itself, the changes that arise from digitalization and specifically from solutions like blockchain technology might change how concepts like ISOs will be evaluated in the future, even on the distribution grid level (iDSO). This is one of the real and very tangible threats digitalization and blockchain technology in particular might pose towards the current business model of distribution network operators.</p>
<p>Though there is a long road ahead before blockchain finally might enter the energy sector, network operators should get involved soon if they want to avoid the above described scenario that might really threaten an important part of their current business model. The question then again remains: Will network operators take an active part in the digitalization process of the energy sector?</p>

1160,"Where energy efficiency is really found is in the minds of men and women",NULL,NULL,"<p>First published <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.onlyelevenpercent.com/where-energy-efficiency-is-really-found-is-in-the-minds-of-men-and-women/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a></p>
<p>We know that there is a massive potential for cost effective energy efficiency in nearly all, well all in fact, sectors and situations. Study after study in many countries and many regions have repeatedly shown this as has case study after case study. We know the efficiency resource is available, now we have to turn it into reserves and use it – we need to get it out of the buildings, out of the factories, out of the power systems and out of transportation. To use the oil and gas resource analogy we are in the position of a small exploration company who have found massive reserves of oil but lack the means or the know-how to exploit it.</p>
<p>So what do we need to really scale up utilisation of the efficiency resource, the cheapest, cleanest and fastest to deploy energy resource we have?</p>
<h3>Well here are (six) things that we need in any country, situation or sector.</h3>

<ol> 	<li>First of all we need to see that the resource is there. Wallace Everett Pratt, a pioneer petroleum geologist said;<strong> “where oil fields are really found is in the minds of men” and it is the same for efficiency. It is only there when you recognise it as being there.</strong> The scale of the resource, as in oil and gas, can also be limited by imagination or technical know-how. Applying integrated design will generally lead to a larger, more economic reserve than using conventional incremental engineering. It opens up bigger reserves in the same way that conceiving of and then implementing horizontal drilling increased oil reserves.</li> 	<li>Someone, and preferably someone with some authority and power needs to believe that it is a) viable and b) economic to spend the time and money needed to identify and then access the reserves. <strong>Viability is in the eyes of the beholder and there is a need for entrepreneurs (in both the private and public sectors) to lead.</strong> Such people are often “unreasonable”. An example is the Empire State Building renovation that used integrated design and reduced energy use by 38%. Without a forceful, informed client in the shape of Tony Malkin <strong>that project would not have happened in the way that it did and at best there would have been smaller, less financially attractive savings, and at worst no efficiency at all.</strong></li> 	<li>There needs to be a good business case. Traditionally energy efficiency business cases have been of the form, invest £x and save £y on energy costs. The world is more complex than that and it has never really been that attractive because just saving money is rarely strategic. That is why there are so many stories of frustrated energy managers or consultants with dozens of “two year payback projects” that have been turned down by CFOs.<strong> In the last few years we have started to recognise the multiple non-energy benefits that efficiency improvements can bring, including greater productivity, better health, better learning outcomes and many more.</strong> These tend to be much more interesting and strategic to decision makers and with strategic investments there is much less focus on the payback.<strong> Energy efficiency advocates need to learn to make better business cases that identify and value all the benefits</strong>. It is not easy to value them but then again it is not easy to value the effect of advertising and PR spend.</li> 	<li><strong>There is a need to spend some money developing the opportunity, taking it from an idea to an investable proposition and that is risk money.</strong> Development requires some level of engineering work, which can be very simple adaptation work for a simple measure based on a single product like high efficiency motors where you can almost replace like for like, (although that may not be the optimum solution of course) through to complex engineering to modify existing systems or structures and calculate interactions between them. As in oil and gas exploration advanced software tools can be useful here but we have to recognise that there is often still a performance gap between what models say and what actually happens. We need better, and standardised tools. Development of all kinds can be complex and iterative but at the end of the day there is no certainty that a real project will happen as a result of development work.<strong> The development process is one that combines engineering, financial work, legal work, and what I call contextual work, looking at how the proposed development interacts with other factors inside and outside the host organisation. It is essentially a process of risk reduction but at the end of the day all development work, whether it is for energy efficiency, a new building, a new product or a new rocket, is high risk, the kind of risk that has to be taken by equity or equity type funding, aided where possible by grants.</strong> Equity funding is very different than debt type funding typically used for project implementation. One of the issues in the market is confusion between development and contracting, particularly around Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) and Energy Performance Contracts (EPCs). ESCos are typically contractors and not developers, they respond to Request for Quotations from clients and don’t go out and develop pipelines at risk. So called super-ESCos such as the Etihad Super ESCo do this kind of multiple project development which is essential for scaling up the market.</li> 	<li><strong>There is a need for project implementation finance.</strong> This can come from inside the host organisation or outside. There is much focus on external funding but the reality is for something like <strong>90-95% of energy efficiency projects the funding is internal.</strong> There is little point developing a project if there is no project implementation finance available. External finance will usually be some form of debt.</li> 	<li><strong>The ability to procure, contract and manage the safe, on-time and on-budget implementation of projects</strong>. Although there is much focus on Energy Performance Contracts they are only one way of contracting for energy efficiency projects and are best suited to large, high value capital projects involving infrastructure upgrades. Most projects are implemented through industry standard contracts used for all kinds of mechanical, electrical and building works or through standard procurement terms.</li> </ol>

<h3>That is pretty much it. Other things to note;</h3>

<ul> 	<li>We need developers who can aggregate demand such as Etihad Super ESCo, EESL, the Saudi Super ESCo and the Carbon &amp; Energy Fund. The super ESCos (or super developers as I prefer to call them) contract the work to ESCos.</li> 	<li>We do need performance measurement and verification.</li> 	<li>We do need project development standardisation as provided by the Investor Confidence Project’s Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™.</li> 	<li>What legal or organisational form is chosen for the super ESCo / super developer is completely irrelevant – there is no right and wrong here – as long as the activities are taken care of. We see successful examples from the public and private sectors.</li> 	<li>Developers seem to perform best when they focus on a sector or segment of the market. A developer of hospital projects is not likely to fare well in the residential sector or even the commercial office sector – the norms, the customers, the experience and the skill sets are too different.</li> 	<li>Where you fund the projects from, and how you fund them i.e. what mechanism is used to recover the investment is irrelevant, different situations will demand different solutions such as simple loans, on-bill recovery or property tax supplements.</li> 	<li>The hard part of funding is the development piece.</li> </ul>
<p>That is all for today. More to follow on this – but in the meantime “just do it”.</p>

<p>An extra $460bn per year needs to be invested on the low-carbon economy globally over the next 12 years to limit global warming to 1.5C, a new paper says. Jocelyn Timperley takes a look.</p>
<p>This is 50% higher than the additional investment needed to meet a 2C limit, the paper says. It is the first to assess the difference in investments and monetary flows between the two temperature goals of the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/interactive-the-paris-agreement-on-climate-change"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">Paris Agreement</a>, the lead author tells Carbon Brief.</p>
<p>The paper also finds a far faster increase in low-carbon energy and energy efficiency investment would be needed to limit warming to 1.5C. Meanwhile, coal investment would not change substantially between a 1.5C and 2C scenario, the lead author says, since a dramatic downscaling of coal investments is already required to meet the 2C goal.</p>
<h3>Financial flows</h3>
<p>The <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/interactive-the-paris-agreement-on-climate-change"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">Paris Agreement</a> says countries should scale up finance to the low-carbon economy. Article 2.1(c) of the deal commits signatories to:</p>
<p>“Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.”</p>
<p>The paper, published in <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.nature.com/nenergy/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">Nature Energy</a>, aims to quantify the scale of financial flows that may be required to meet the overarching temperature goals of the Paris deal. It assesses how much would be needed for four scenarios.</p>
<p>In the first, countries meet the targets laid out in their current individual <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/Japan/1/20150717_Japan%27s%20INDC.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">climate pledges</a> (“nationally determined contributions”, or <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/paris-2015-tracking-country-climate-pledges"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">NDC</a>s). The second looks at meeting the Paris goal of limiting global warming to “well below 2C”. The third scenario considers a world where the aspirational Paris target of limiting warming to 1.5C is met. These are compared to a business-as-usual scenario with no further tightening of current climate and energy policies.</p>
<p>The study combines the results from six different integrated assessment models (IAMs) to make its findings more robust. Each model represents the global energy system and the various mitigation options for the future in a slightly different way. All scenarios are in line with a “middle-of-the-road” future where social, economic, and technological trends broadly follow their historical patterns (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">SSP2</a>).</p>
<p>The findings show an extra $132bn investment in low-carbon technology and energy efficiency is needed between 2016 and 2030 to meet the NDC targets, compared to a business-as-usual scenario.</p>
<p>The additional investments needed to meet climate pledges amounts to less then a tenth of the $1,700bn invested in the global energy system in 2016, according to the International Energy Agency (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.iea.org/publications/wei2017/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">IEA</a>).</p>
<p>It is also comparable in scale to <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/climate-finance-challenge-shifting-trillions"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">$100bn</a> per year in climate finance that rich countries have promised developing countries to help fund their climate efforts.</p>
<p><a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://type=auto"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">David McCollum</a>, senior research scholar at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.iiasa.ac.at/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">IIASA</a>) and lead author of the paper, says this means the $100bn pledge would go a long way towards developing countries meeting their NDC targets. He tells Carbon Brief:</p>
<p><strong>“It’s something that, in theory, could be done, if priorities were set in the right way…But as we know from this research and other research, the NDC targets don’t get us anywhere near where we need to be for 2C, and certainly not 1.5C. It starts us on the right track, but it’s already missing the mark in terms of emissions reductions by 2025-2030.”</strong></p>
<p>The chart below shows the results of the investment gap found by the study, as well as the much higher average annual investment needed up to 2050. This is due to the need for clean energy investments to accelerate beyond 2030, raising the annual average figure.</p>

<p>Annual global investment gaps in low-carbon energy and energy efficiency in tightened policy scenarios, averaged up to 2030 and 2050. The scenarios consider a world where the NDC country pledges are met, and where the 2C and 1.5C temperature limits of the Paris Agreement are met. Source: McCollum, D.L. et al.

Chart by Carbon Brief.</p>
<h3>2C vs 1.5C</h3>
<p>For the 2C target, the extra annual investment needed in low-carbon energy and energy efficiency between now and 2030 increases to $303bn. Low-carbon investments would overtake fossil fuel investments as early as 2025 and grow rapidly thereafter, shown in the figure below. Around two-thirds of such supply side energy investments today are fossil-related, with the remaining third in low carbon.</p>

<p><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""399"" height=""599"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/2be41002d6.png"" width=""935"" style="""" /></p>

Values are given in supply-side investments as a share of total supply-side investments. Therefore, these values do not include energy efficiency investments. Source: McCollum, D.L. et al. (2018) via Carbon Brief</p>
<p>For the 1.5C target, an additional $458bn would be needed, the study says. This would mean a “step-change” in terms of the amount invested per tonne of CO2 avoided, it adds.</p>
<p>The extra investment effort needed going from 2C to 1.5C was surprising, says McCollum:</p>
<p><strong>“Going this extra bit from 2C to 1.5C, it’s only a few hundred gigatonnes of carbon, but the investment efforts – particular in this near-term out to 2030 – what it means in terms of ramping up renewables and efficiency is much greater. So it’s non-linear in other words: there’s this tipping point if we want to move beyond 2C and go to 1.5C.”</strong></p>
<p>It is also important to note that limiting global temperatures to 1.5C is <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/limiting-global-warming-1point5-celcius-would-have-significant-economic-benefits"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">expected</a> to have economic advantages. One paper published earlier this year <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/limiting-global-warming-1point5-celcius-would-have-significant-economic-benefits"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">found</a> per capita GDP would be 5% higher by 2100 if temperatures are stabilised at 1.5C rather than 2C.</p>
<h3>Coal decline</h3>
<p>One thing that does not change substantially between the 1.5C and 2C scenarios, however, is the need to move away from unabated coal investments, says McCollum.</p>
<p>Here, the difference going from 2C to 1.5C is even fewer investments into oil and natural gas, the paper finds. In some models, the authors found some limited room for natural gas investments with carbon capture and storage (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/absence-carbon-capture-storage-biggest-challenge-2c-limit"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">CCS</a>). Meanwhile, the share of investments going to electricity transmission and distribution, already currently around a quarter of all energy investments, will continue to rise.</p>
<p><a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/profile/samuel-fankhauser/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">Prof Sam Fankhauser</a>, director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, says the key point from the new study is the need to use existing capital flows differently, rather than mobilising additional capital. He told Carbon Brief:</p>
<p><strong>“We need some extra investment, too, but the main thing is redirecting existing energy investment from fossil fuels to renewables. So no surprise, then, that accelerating clean investment will overtake declining fossil fuel investment within 10 years.”</strong></p>
<p>He adds that the same redirection of capital is needed in other areas, such as transport, industry and urban design.</p>

<p>District energy (DE) is defined as a system of energy generation plant and distribution infrastructure that supplies heat and/or chilled water and electricity to a number of domestic or non-domestic buildings and end customers. The scale of DE networks can range from small clusters of buildings, such as within a housing development, to major city-wide schemes. They may be served by multiple energy sources with high temperature transition pipelines and lower temperature distribution networks and can be developed in numerous phases.</p>

<p>District energy can have a wide variety of owners. There are different models ranging from a single owner to multiple owners. For many schemes, the ownership of the cogeneration plant is separate from the heat using part. In many cases, it is the public sector at various levels but the private sector also plays a big role.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>District energy and financing</h3>
<p>Unsurprisingly, district energy requires a long-term financial commitment that fits poorly with a focus on short-term returns on investment. Benefits to the community include avoided costs of energy through the use of surplus and wasted heat energy, and reduced investment in individual household or building heating equipment. District energy networks, heat-only boiler stations, and cogeneration plants require high initial capital expenditure and financing. This means that arranging financing can be extremely difficult. ICP is designed to help that process – the relationship between the asset owner and the project developer – as will be shown below.</p>
<p>One of the major barriers identified in investing in district energy / energy supply and industrial energy efficiency is the lack of standardisation of the process.&nbsp; The process is essentially the interaction between the asset owner/manager and the project developer (an energy service company, an installation or engineering company).&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many factors and related barriers that influence decisions and action. The Investor Confidence Project is there to remove many of the complications and risks in improving your company’s energy performance. It ensures that the process of choosing what to do, how to do it and how to finance it is standardised, giving you assurance. It can help senior management better understand energy efficiency from a strategic perspective because it does remove risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For district energy the Investor Confidence Project focuses on improving the energy performance of existing systems with, undoubtedly, some exceptions sprinkled in as the approach is tried and tested with pilot projects. The scope includes district energy infrastructure upgrades, such as energy centre plant replacement and pipework insulation upgrades.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>On September 11th, the Investor Confidence Project Europe will be holding training for project developers involved in district energy</strong>. <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/events/detailed/6131dd305dc06e0badae59d4fb712c24/online-training-3-icp-industry-energy-supply-protocol/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window""><strong>You can register here fro free.</strong></a></p>
<p>Since I write on it regularly, readers will know about the ICP process. Just to remind you, the concept of the Investor Confidence Project is simple to understand. The protocols set out requirements for an investment package to be submitted by a project developer that covers critical stages throughout the project lifecycle. A third-party Quality Assurance Provider subsequently reviews this documentation. Compliant projects are awarded the Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ certification. This process enables standardised project performance underwriting, leading to better data on performance, and a more efficient marketplace with less duplicative engineering and lower transaction costs. The result should be an increase in deal flow and a more transparent and efficient market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three main parties involved in the process: the asset owner/manager (public or private), the project developer (often an energy service company or an engineering company) and the financial institutions that are available to invest. To make it work, the project developer is key because he/she is normally the link amongst all three.&nbsp; More importantly,<strong> it is the project developer who holds the golden key: he or she knows about the ICP protocols and knows how to use them</strong>.<strong> The project developer can explain it to the asset owner/manager and can explain how the protocol will form the key element in their relationship leading to an implemented measure that is financed.</strong></p>

<h3>Final words</h3>
<p>ICP was brought to Europe to develop a system to give confidence to all active stakeholders. There are still concerns that investing in energy efficiency is risky. ICP is designed to change that. ICP started with investments in buildings and is now broadening the scope to include industry, district energy and street lighting through a two-year project funded by the European Commission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be a success in the market place following the two-year start-up phase, ICP needs to build its foundation – you who are heavily involved in district energy through project development. There is a need for more project developers so that asset owners can feel more comfortable. There is need for a critical mass of trained and credentialed project developers to make the system work. The benefits are that, once fully in place in your country and throughout Europe, this will lead to more work. The whole purpose is to get more investment in energy conservation measures to meet many of our economic and social objectives. And it is also important to meet your own corporate or individual objectives: reducing costs, improving competitiveness, providing health benefits, and much more ICP is but one way but it is an important step.</p>
<h5>So, please consider taking the upcoming training.&nbsp; There will be more opportunities in the upcoming months, but the sooner you do, the better.</h5>

1163,"The next wave of renewable energy?",NULL,NULL,"<p>First published <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://energytransition.org/2018/06/the-next-wave-of-renewable-energy/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a>. By Chris Bentley</p>
<p><strong>Marine hydropower could make waves in renewable energy, if it can overcome technological and financial challenges. Chris Bentley takes a look.</strong></p>
<p>For now, the wave and tidal energy industry remains in its infancy (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/icetsarina/25807306508"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">Public Domain</a>)</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever been tossed off their surfboard or clobbered by a wave breaking unexpectedly as they waded out from the beach knows there's a lot of energy in the ocean.</p>
<p>Harnessing that power could unlock a major new resource of renewable energy that's more predictable and energy-dense than wind or solar. According to the World Energy Council, wave and tidal energy could one day provide 10 percent of the world's electricity. In the U.S. <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/marine-and-hydrokinetic-resource-assessment-and-characterization"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">the Department of Energy says</a> developing just one sixth of the available wave energy on the West Coast, Hawaii and Alaska could power more than 5 million homes and support roughly 33,000 jobs.</p>
<p>So far wave and tidal energy is largely in the test phase, but entrepreneurs in the field say that's going to change soon. Last month the U.S. Department of Energy <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.energy.gov/articles/undersecretary-energy-menezes-announces-23-million-new-funding-advance-marine-energy"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">announced $23 million in new funding</a>for ""next-generation wave and tidal/current systems""-its biggest such block of grants yet.</p>
<p>""This administration has a particular focus on early-stage research, which works particularly well for wave and tidal,"" says Alejandro Moreno, director of the Department's Water Power Technologies Office. ""Imagine wind and solar in the early 1970s: people in their backyards throwing up ideas and seeing what works.""</p>
<p><strong>Every new technology has to make it through early-stage research and development, but wave and tidal face technical challenges that other renewable energy sources didn't during their rise from obscure experiments to widely applied sources of electricity. The ocean is an unforgiving environment for delicate machinery. Stronger waves bring more energy that could power coastal communities, but they can also overwhelm wave power devices. Salt water corrodes the equipment. Algae, barnacles and other marine life flock to the underwater devices as they would a reef, gumming up moving parts in a process the industry calls ""biofouling.""</strong><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>""And if it breaks, it sinks,"" says Moreno.</strong></p>
<p>Research labs and private companies have so far struggled to harvest wave and tidal power economically, in part because the market hasn't settled on a single solution or prototype.</p>
<p>""In a sports racecar you could say, 'oh it's the aerodynamics, let's fix that and it doesn't matter what it costs,'"" says Jochem Weber, chief engineer of the Water Power Program at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. ""With wave and tidal there's not a single thing going so wrong that it couldn't be fixed, but it's a multi-parametric optimization problem.""</p>
<p>As a result there's a wide variety of designs and applications in development. Seattle-based Oscilla Power is pitching a <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/oscilla-power-triton-wave-energy-converter/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">wave electricity converter that has been compared to a ""mechanical jellyfish.""</a> Other designs anchor a large flap to the seafloor that sways back and forth as waves roll over it and use the motion to turn a turbine. The natural motion of the waves could also force air through a tube suspended in the water column, driving a turbine with forced air.</p>
<p><strong>Some wave energy prototypes are tied to specific uses instead of general power generation.</strong> Boston-based Resolute Marine Energy is working with the African island nation of Cape Verde to develop a water desalination system powered by wave energy. In a video of their prototype, a fiberglass flap at the bottom of a shallow bay just off the coast of Cape Verde sways like seaweed beneath the waves. The motion pumps saltwater up to a reverse osmosis facility on the beach, which runs on energy collected from the waves.</p>
<p>Bill Staby, the company's co-founder and CEO, says it's a perfect situation for wave energy: Cape Verde currently imports expensive diesel fuel to power energy-intensive desalination for most of its freshwater. Wave energy is renewable and, according to Staby, cheaper than competing sources of energy when it's part of such a system.</p>
<p>John Ferland, President and COO of Maine-based Ocean Renewable Power Company agrees the technology could find a foothold in remote communities where the cost of electricity is high. His company is working with the Alaskan village of Igiugig on an underwater river hydropower system to replace costly imported diesel.</p>
<blockquote><p>""We're lowering the price of electricity while also making a huge dent in greenhouse gas emissions in those areas,"" says Ferland. ""The global pitch is going to be that this is a clean, abundant, renewable source of energy particularly compatible with areas that have working ports. It's a very local industry that provides jobs locally.""</p></blockquote>
<p>Other companies have proposed using wave energy devices to power ships and unmanned submersibles so they don't need to refuel in the middle of a trip. Another application might be open-water aquaculture, or fish farming in the middle of the ocean.</p>
<p>Wave and tidal energy systems could also be combined with other coastal infrastructure. <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.power-technology.com/projects/mutriku-wave/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">The Basque Country in Spain</a> and <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.oist.jp/news-center/news/2017/9/20/sustainable-future-powered-sea"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">Japan</a> have both experimented with seawalls that double as renewable energy projects.</p>
<p>Ideas for tidal energy-harvesting the power of the tides instead of the waves-are decidedly larger in scale. More than 100 billion metric tons of water course through in and out of The Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia every day, more than the flow of all the world's freshwater rivers combined. That's long made it a prime candidate for tidal power, but any place with dramatic tidal shifts could potentially produce renewable energy.</p>
<p>The Scottish company Atlantis Resources last year launched <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.atlantisresourcesltd.com/projects/meygen/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">MeyGen</a>-hailed as the world's first <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/12/worlds-first-large-scale-tidal-energy-farm-launches-scotland"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">large-scale tidal energy project</a>-in the Pentland Firth, a strait between the Orkney Islands and the northern coast of Scotland. Eventually they hope to generate nearly 400 megawatts of electricity from 269 underwater turbines, enough to power 175,000 homes.</p>
<blockquote><p>""That area is wild, very windy, very fast water ... it's famous for fast currents so it's perfect,"" says Genevra Harker-Klimes, who studies marine renewable energy at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are also efforts underway in the U.S. In 2012 Portland, Maine-based Ocean Renewable Power Company first tested their TidGen device in the Bay of Fundy and then installed another system in Cobscook Bay, along Maine's border with Canada. Researchers at the University of Rhode Island and the Marine Renewable Energy Collaborative <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/science-and-technology/2018/05/15/on-cape-cod-tides-could-become-a-renewable-energy-source"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">recently started testing a tidal turbine in the Cape Cod canal</a>. The company <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.power-technology.com/projects/roosevelt-island-tidal-energy-project-new-york/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">Verdant Power is working on a pilot project in New York's East River</a> off of Roosevelt Island.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy is developing its own <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://oregonstate.edu/wave"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">full-scale, grid-connected marine test facility</a> off the coast of Newport, Oregon that is expected to be up and running in 2021. For now, however, the industry remains in its infancy.</p>
<blockquote><p>""One problem is the difficulty of getting devices into the water to reduce these technological uncertainties,"" says Harker-Klimes of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, ""and the other is getting the financing.""</p></blockquote>
<p>Another open question is tidal and wave energy's impact on marine ecosystems.</p>
<p>""It's a carefully considered aspect. Nobody can say at this stage what it means for a coastline if you take 30 percent of the wave energy out,"" says Jochem Weber of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, ""but we're a long way from the point.""</p>

<p>Just open any news service these days and</p>
<p>you are confronted with more evidence that we have no choice but to</p>
<p>significantly do more to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Daily we are</p>
<p>reading about fires, floodings, droughts, heat waves, whatever. Naturally,</p>
<p>these cannot all be attributed to climate change but there is enough evidence</p>
<p>for us to take action.</p>



<p>We, in the energy efficiency community, are</p>
<p>trying to create more awareness of the importance of greater energy</p>
<p>efficiency. We are trying to better</p>
<p>understand consumer needs. We are trying to remove barriers to ensure that the</p>
<p>market works more effectively and more ambitiously to reduce those emissions.</p>



<p>So, the 1970 song from Paul Simon (of Simon</p>

<p>of these words:</p>

<p>""I'm on your side, oh, when times get rough. And friends just can't be found, like a bridge over troubled water. I will lay me down, like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need you in the investor community to sing these words – and more.</p>



<p>Right now the Investor Confidence Project,</p>
<p>a project funded by the European Commission, is trying to bring those words to</p>
<p>life.<strong> It is well documented that many energy efficiency measures are not</strong></p>
<p><strong>undertaken because of a lack of standardisation – of the process.</strong>&nbsp; Yes, that process is the relationship between</p>
<p>the asset owner (the business) and the project developer (often an energy</p>
<p>service company or an engieering firm).</p>



<p><strong>There are many factors that influence decisions</strong></p>
<p><strong>and action. The Investor Confidence Project is there to remove many of the</strong></p>
<p><strong>complications and risks in improving the energy performance in industry, street</strong></p>
<p><strong>lighting and energy supply. ICP has developed – and is now testing – a</strong></p>
<p><strong>standardised approach.</strong></p>



<p>ICP brought to Europe to develop a system to</p>
<p>give confidence to all active stakeholders. <strong>There are still concerns that</strong></p>

<p>While working with all stakeholders,<strong> investors</strong></p>
<p><strong>are key.</strong> The ICP Europe Investor Network is comprised of energy efficiency</p>
<p>investors who recognise the benefit of industry best practice and standardised</p>
<p>energy renovation project delivery. Members of the Network support the use of the ICP Protocols and</p>
<p>Credentialing System because these systems increase confidence in project</p>

1165,"Optimizing Electrical Motor Efficiency: Get More Bang for Your Buck",NULL,NULL,"<p>First published <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.dfliq.net/optimizing-electrical-motor-efficiency-get-more-bang-for-your-buck/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Electrical motors are devices that convert electrical energy into mechanical force. They operate on the principles of electromagnetism, using the interaction between winding currents and magnetic fields to generate force. Some motors, like those used in the transportation industry can reverse the effect and generate electricity too, converting force into electricity.</p>
<p>Many industrial plants attribute over 70% of their power consumption to motors, so even a slight increase in efficiency can dramatically cut energy spending and improve profits too.</p>
<h3>How to Increase Motor Efficiency</h3>

<p>There are a number of areas where losses in motor efficiency can occur. They range from frictional and heat losses to dissipation of the magnetic field within the core of the motor. Even the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.dfliq.net/electrical-materials-products/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">type of materials used</a> can affect a motor's overall efficiency.</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""402"" height=""585"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/0e3f141044.jpg"" width=""835"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>


<h3>Improving the efficiency of motors can be segregated into 3 phases:</h3>
<h3>Phase 1 - Assessment</h3>
<p>The first step is to monitor and document each motor, and assess the current performance level. Gather and record details which are essential for assessing the motor's current efficiency or consumption, like:</p>
<ul> 	<li>The age of the motor</li> 	<li>How much horsepower the motor is actually generating</li> 	<li>Power and consumption ratings</li> 	<li>What kind of control levels have been implemented in your facility</li> 	<li>Identify the various loads that the motor is subjected to by using a power logger</li> </ul>
<p>Once you have all the information, you can use an efficiency calculator system, like motor master, to calculate the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.dfliq.net/electrical-materials-products/motor-control/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">efficiency of the motor</a>.</p>
<h3>Phase 2 - Improvement</h3>
<p>Right away, you can use the information you've gathered during phase 1 to make some immediate improvements. Older motors are inherently inefficient, so they can be replaced with modern higher-efficiency ones. If there are any that are over or under-sized, replace them with better sized models to improve running efficiency.</p>
<p>To optimize the motors you intend on keeping, inspect them for three variables that are known to reduce efficiency and even the life of the motor significantly:</p>
<ol> 	<li>Voltage Unbalance In a three-phase motor, voltage unbalance is the difference in voltages across the phases. For optimum performance and efficiency, the voltages of the phases should be the same, or as close to it as possible:<br /> 	Calculating voltage unbalance (Vu) is pretty straightforward: 	<ul> 		<li>Average the voltage across all three phases (Va)</li> 		<li>Calculate the highest deviance from the average (Vm)</li> 		<li>Divide the difference by average voltage and multiply it by 100</li> 	</ul> 	<p>[(Va-Vm)X100] ÷ Va = Vu</p> 	<p>With an average voltage of 460V, just a 5V difference creates a voltage unbalance of 1.1%. While National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and Standard EN50160 call for a maximum unbalance of 5% and 2% respectively, a difference of 1% or below is usually recommended.</p> 	</li> 	<li>Current Unbalance Current unbalance is similar to voltage imbalance. As opposed to the voltage, it is calculated by measuring the difference between the current being drawn at each of a three-phase motor's leg.The method for correcting current unbalance depends on the factors causing it: 	<ul> 		<li>Power-factor correcting device for unbalance caused by the power supply</li> 		<li>Rewinding or replacing the motor for internal faults or faulty installation</li> 		<li>In some cases, buying a new motor is preferred- 		<ul> 			<li>Motors over 15 years old and under 40hp</li> 			<li>Non-specialty motors under 15hp</li> 			<li>Rewinding cost exceeds 50% of purchasing a new motor</li> 		</ul> 		</li> 	</ul> 	</li> 	<li>Power Factor The power factor is the ratio (or percentage) of the real power (in KW) of a motor and its apparent (total) power (in KVA). Apparent power is an expression of the real power of the motor and its reactive power in kilovars (kVAR). The power factor should be evaluated on all major loads and circuits, not just motors.An increase in a motor's reactive power increases the apparent power. This causes the power factor to decrease.<br /> 	The closer the power factor is to 1 (or 100%), the better, so decreasing reactive power is generally better for efficiency. 	<p>The goal of ascertaining the power factor is to identify which loads cause reactive power to lag and design strategies that can improve the power factor.</p> 	</li> </ol>
<h3>Phase 3 - Prolong Life Period</h3>
<p>Apart from the methods mentioned above, there are a few more strategies you can use to increase the life period of motors in your facility, and thus their operational efficiency too:</p>
<ul> 	<li>Lamination - Instead of cheaper carbon steels, lamination containing steels that have a little silicon can be used. Using thinner lamination and increasing their length reduces core losses by limiting the effects of saturation and hysteresis.</li> 	<li>Lubrication - The lubrication interval is decided by a number of factors, so you should be careful while applying lubricants. Different types of grease, even those with the same elements, should never be mixed.</li> 	<li>Insulation - Efficiency can also decrease due to eddy currents. These can be minimized by insulating sheets or lamination properly.</li> </ul>

<p>With the Investor Ready Energy Efficiency (IREE) certificate for a greater reliability for builders and investors.</p>
<p>Did you know that there is a certification which proves that your energy efficiency projects were developed and monitored according to a standardized and transparent process to increase confidence in your calculated energy savings? In addition, by following the standardized protocols the expenditure for due diligence is reduced significantly. You just need to obtain the IREE ™ Certificate (Investor Ready Energy Efficiency ™) powered by ICP (Investor Confidence Project).</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""403"" height=""353"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/ccb4302dae.png"" width=""850"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>


<h3>What is ICP?</h3>
<p>The Investor Confidence Project (ICP) provides a framework for energy efficiency project throughout all stages of a project lifecycle (development, monitoring and verification). This framework standardizes the verifiable projects into verifiable project classes in order to reduce transaction costs associated with technical underwriting, and increase reliability and consistency of energy savings. The ICP protocols and ICP System provide a comprehensive framework of elements that is flexible enough to accommodate the wide range of methods and resources that are specific to individual projects.</p>
<h3>How can my company benefit from ICP?</h3>
<p>ICP increases confidence in your energy efficiency project by ensuring that the project developer and a third party assessor are highly qualified and have received the ICP authorization. Therefore your project is double checked by experts in every single stage of your project to apply high standards and as quality assurance. Furthermore IREE ™ certified projects enhances the chance for better conditions for your loan and improves the attractiveness for a third party investor.</p>
<h3>How to get an IREE ™certificate?</h3>
<p>The method applied is very similar to energy performance contracting. Your energy efficiency project has to be developed together with a Project Developer (PD) and a Quality Assurance Assessor (QAA) listed in the ICP-System. The PD supports your company to meet the technical, financial and documentary requirements demanded by the ICP protocols. The QAA represents a third independent party, who reviews the project and ensures that the project was developed in compliance with the ICP demands. After completing the ICP-compliant project development, the energy efficiency projects receive the Investor Ready Energy Efficiency ™ certificate.</p>
<h3>ERN is the first qualified Project Developer and a Quality Assurance Assessor for industrial projects in Germany</h3>
<p>ERN is the first energy service provider to be able to develop energy efficiency projects in industry in accordance with the requirements of ICP. In addition, ERN has also qualified as a Quality Assurance Assessor, enabling it to qualify third party projects for ICP compliance.</p>
<p>Do you have any difficulties in reaching the calculated energy savings? Are you unsure if your calculated savings will really happen? Are you planning an energy efficiency project and you would like to get a highly qualified quality check? Our ERN specialists will be happy to help you evaluate and optimize your energy efficiency projects with confidence, achieving your planned energy savings.</p>

1167,"Offshore wind rising to challenge king coal in Polish energy market",NULL,NULL,"<p>First published <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.owjonline.com/news/view,offshore-wind-rising-to-challenge-king-coal-in-polish-energy-market_51716.htm"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Poland's energy and electricity markets are undergoing major changes. As costs fall in the offshore wind industry, so it is becoming price-competitive with more carbon-intensive forms of energy that have long dominated in the country.</strong></p>
<p>Turning to offshore wind is not without political risk in a country like Poland in which coal has long played such an important role, but Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki now appears to be an advocate of wind power and Poland has emerged as one of several northern and east European countries in which offshore wind looks set to play a much larger role in future. <strong>Supporting the move towards renewable energy, Poland has taken the first steps to introduce greater flexibility into its energy system but ageing grid infrastructure will require modernisation.</strong></p>
<p>Speaking to OWJ in early May, MAKE offshore analyst Søren Lassen and his colleagues see Poland as a prime example of an emerging northern and eastern European offshore wind market where significant potential has been created by the steep fall in the cost of offshore wind energy in recent years.</p>
<p>Mr Lassen said that MAKE anticipated that selected emerging offshore wind markets in northern east Europe - of which Poland is an example - will surpass <strong>4 GW of installed capacity by 2027</strong>.</p>
<p>In an analysis of these markets, Mr Lassen and colleagues said plummeting strike prices have made offshore wind emerge as an attractive substitute across markets in northern east Europe, especially those looking to curb greenhouse gas emissions, enhance energy security, and avert the risk of a generation deficit.</p>
<blockquote><p>""Low strike prices in established offshore markets in Europe and the growing competition in emerging markets such as Taiwan and the US have increased the attractiveness of the emerging offshore markets in northern east Europe for offshore developers,"" MAKE said in a recent research note.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Until recently Poland has probably not been among those countries focusing on reducing emissions, its domestic energy market being heavily skewed towards coal, but it is having to import more and more coal from neighbouring countries and the Polish Government has begun to align its energy policy more closely with the European Union and with the latter's targets for growing use of renewable energy</strong>. As the 'energy climate' in the country has begun to change so companies active in the offshore wind market in Europe - and at least one Polish company - have signalled their willingness to develop offshore wind, if the policy can be developed that would provide reliable support for renewables. This change in the outlook for renewables is significant given that until recently the Polish onshore wind sector had been adversely affected by legislation.</p>
<p><strong>The move away from coal to renewables has implications for employment in the coal sector</strong> but Poland also has manufacturers and heavy industry that could benefit significantly from the development of an offshore wind supply chain.</p>
<blockquote><p>""We have to change and be really responsive to mega-trends and also to keep power prices on reasonable levels,"" Joanna Mackowiak-Pandera, the head of Warsaw-based Forum Energii, which consults with companies and authorities on the wind industry, <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-04-27/even-europe-s-coal-addict-wants-to-get-clean"" target=""_blank"">told Bloomberg</a>. ""What we see now in the power sector is that finally we have to meet some targets.""</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>""Offshore wind has the potential to lead to significant job creation in Poland,"" Mr Lassen told OWJ, a sentiment <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-04-27/even-europe-s-coal-addict-wants-to-get-clean"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">backed up by a McKinsey report</a> from 2016.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr Lassen also highlighted the fact that, although offshore wind has primarily been developed in the North Sea, there is now growing experience of offshore wind in other countries in the Baltic, such as Germany. Poland could take benefit from synergies, technical expertise and experience in these countries as it moves into offshore wind energy.</p>
<blockquote><p>""Germany will install more than 1 GW by the end of 2019 and recently awarded an addtional 750 MW of offshore wind in the Baltic, experience from which will play into the Polish market as it develops,"" he told OWJ.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, as he also noted, developing offshore wind in the Polish Baltic will not be without its challenges: these include grid connection. Above all, he said, the right kind of enabling policy from the Polish Government is essential.</p>
<p>Bloomberg New Energy Finance associate, Dr Tom Harries agreed that policy - or the lack of a coherent, supportive policy - is what has been holding the Polish market back, but this is changing. BVG Associates director Giles Hundleby agreed that the Polish market was suddenly showing significant potential. <strong>He cited a recent <a href=""http://www.owjonline.com/news/view,statoil-in-polish-offshore-wind-breakthrough_50997.htm"" target=""_blank"">agreement between Norwegian energy major Statoil and Polenergia</a>, the largest privately-owned energy group in Poland, to collaborate on the construction of offshore windfarms in the Baltic.</strong> This had galvanised Polish players such as PKN Orlen to push for the development of offshore wind projects.</p>
<ul> 	<li><strong>Mr Hundleby </strong>said although the Polish Government has yet to propose an auction process for offshore wind, he anticipated that once policy has been developed industrial players could be in a position to proceed with final investment decisions in the early 2020s, with construction getting under way in the mid-2020s. ""First of all, the state needs to define the process,"" he said.</li> 	<li><strong>State-owned Polish transmission system operator PSE</strong> said as much as 8 GW of offshore wind capacity could be installed in Poland. PSE president Eryk Klosowski said 4 GW of offshore wind could be installed in the Polish sector of the Baltic by 2026/27 with up to 8 GW in the longer term.</li> 	<li><strong>WindEurope chief executive Giles Dickson</strong> said Poland has become a major player in the offshore wind supply chain in recent years with large investments in the manufacturing of turbine foundations and the cranes and jack-up vessels used in installation and maintenance. The Polish wind industry now supports 12,000 jobs. This number would grow significantly with the development of a domestic offshore wind market.</li> 	<li><strong>Mr Dickson</strong> said that, after a period of stagnation in onshore wind, Poland had an opportunity to put itself back on the European wind energy map, help diversify the country's energy mix and support further growth and job creation in the offshore wind supply chain.</li> </ul>
<blockquote><p>""The skills and industrial expertise needed to meet these volumes is in place. It is great that the transmission system operator has confirmed that the Polish electricity grid can support them too. The Baltic offers enormous growth potential for offshore wind and it's very good to see that Poland is gearing up to play its part in fulfilling that.""</p></blockquote>
<ul> 	<li><strong>Polish Wind Energy Association (PWEA) president Janusz Gajowiecki</strong> said Polish companies could deliver up to 50% of the components required to build offshore windfarms. The PWEA has identified almost 80 companies that could deliver the necessary products and services, starting from offshore windfarm design and planning; production and installation of turbine components and connection infrastructure; to offshore windfarm operation and maintenance.</li> </ul>
<p>Statoil signed its agreement with Polenergia in March 2018. The company initialled an agreement with Polenergia to acquire a 50% interest in two early phase offshore wind development projects in Poland, Baltyk Srodkowy III (BSIII) and Baltyk Srodkowy II (BSII). The projects have a combined capacity of 1.2 GW. Statoil is also entering into a 50/50 joint venture with Polenergia to mature the projects with Statoil managing the development, construction and operational phases.</p>
<ul> 	<li><strong>Statoil executive vice president of new energy solutions Irene Rummelhoff</strong> highlighted that Polenergia is an experienced energy company with a growing renewable portfolio and indepth knowledge of the Polish electricity market. She said Statoil has an ambition to grow significantly in the renewable energy industry, investing up to €10Bn (US$12Bn) by 2030. ""This acquisition strengthens our presence in the Baltic, providing opportunities for scale and synergies in the long term,"" she said.</li> </ul>
<p>The Baltyk Srodkowy II and III windfarm areas are in the Baltic approximately 27 km and 40 km from the port of Leba in water depths of 20-40 m.</p>
<p><strong>Shortly after Statoil's announcement, PKN Orlen announced a tender to develop a preliminary technical concept to determine options for implementing an offshore wind project in the Baltic. The company holds a licence for a 1.2 GW windfarm.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>""Embarking on a windfarm project is in line with our strategic objectives and plans for Poland's transition to a low-carbon economy. We hope the tender attracts strong interest from domestic firms,"" said PKN Orlen executive director Marcin Wasilewski.</p></blockquote>

1168,"Evolution in energy efficiency financing",NULL,NULL,"<p>First published <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.onlyelevenpercent.com/evolution-in-energy-efficiency-financing/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<p>On the 9th July I attended the launch of the Mayor of London's Energy Efficiency Fund (MEEF), a £500m public-private energy efficiency fund established by the Greater London Authority and being managed by Amber Infrastructure. I was reminded of a similar day in October 2011 when I attended the launch of the London Energy Efficiency Fund (LEEF).</p>
<p>MEEF represents the scale of the ambition in London and is a significant step-up in the level of funds specifically available to energy efficiency projects. MEEF is the largest public-private energy efficiency fund in Europe. It was an appropriate occasion to reflect on some of the significant changes in thinking and practice in energy efficiency financing in the seven years between the launches of LEEF and MEEF. (In the interest of full disclosure I have served as the independent member of the Investment Committee of LEEF since 2014).</p>
<p>First of all there is increased recognition of <strong>the importance of energy efficiency in achieving climate goals</strong>. <strong>These days the EC talks about ""efficiency first"" which is a significant change.</strong> Clearly there is still a long way to go to reset the balance between energy supply and energy demand but things have improved.</p>
<p>There is also much greater clarity on the real barriers to financing energy efficiency. Back in 2011 there was still a perception that the main issue was ""lack of finance"" and that just providing funds would lead to a flow of projects being financed.<strong> Reality turned out to be different.</strong> Several funds around Europe were established and had difficulties deploying funds due to a lack of well developed bankable projects. It has become clear that <strong>there is a need for some kind of assistance to develop projects to make them investable</strong> which there will be in the case of MEEF. LEEF deployed funds successfully through consistent and significant efforts to work with project developers and owners to develop projects through to implementation. <strong>Project development is the real gap we need to fill to turn the energy efficiency resource into productive assets generating economic and environmental returns.</strong></p>
<p>In the last few years the importance of non-energy benefits, which are often more strategic and more valuable than energy cost savings, has been recognised through work by Catherine Cooremans and others, as well as by the International Energy Agency. <strong>Valuing and selling non-energy benefits is a critical need.</strong> Many energy efficiency projects are incorporated into larger projects carried out for other reasons such as bringing buildings up to modern standards and any policy or financing programme must recognise this.</p>
<p>We have seen the development and introduction of several tools that support energy efficiency financing. These include <strong>the Investor Confidence Project</strong>, originally developed for buildings and now available in Europe for industry, street lighting and district energy. (ICP in Europe has been supported by Horizon 2020).<strong> ICP introduced the concept of standardisation for project development and documentation as well as a certification system for projects, Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™</strong>. The Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group's (EEFIG) work developing a database of 10,000 projects (the Derisking Energy Efficiency Platform, DEEP) and the Underwriting Toolkit, are useful tools for people developing financing programmes or funds.</p>
<p>The last year or so has seen some significant developments including<strong> the EMF-ECBC Energy Efficient Mortgage Initiative which is bringing many financial institutions together to build a standardised pan-European mortgage mechanism that will incentivise people to improve the energy efficiency of their homes through preferential financing.</strong> The EU-PACE project, (like the mortgage initiative supported by Horizon 2020), is working to introduce funding of energy efficiency measures through property taxes. In the US the PACE market has taken off in the residential and commercial sectors. Significantly the PACE market in the US has seen a number of secondary market transactions with portfolios of PACE loans being refinanced through securitisation. Creating a secondary market large enough for the green bond market remains a holy grail.</p>
<p>A major positive change in the last two years has been the rapid rise of activity in green financing, particularly the involvement of central banks. <strong>Ultimately action by bank regulators to address systemic risks in the finance system may have more effect on energy efficiency levels than traditional energy policies or regulations.</strong> Energy efficiency should be a major part of the green finance movement - the danger is that it gets less attention because it is more difficult than just funding renewables. The Energy Efficient Mortgage initiative is a great example of addressing energy efficiency and the green finance market together.</p>
<p>So in seven years the energy efficiency financing market has evolved - it has grown in understanding, capability and scale. I used to use a quote from a banker in the US who said ""the problem with the energy efficiency finance market is that the ratio of conferences to deals is too high"". There is no doubt that the ratio is getting better but of course there is still a long way to go until energy efficiency financing is main-stream.</p>

1169,"ICP – the way financial institutions can make fighting climate change a business case",NULL,NULL,"
<p>On September 12-14, 2018, San Francisco</p>
<p>hosted the Global Climate Action Summit. The operative word is on “action.” At the summit, the Joint Statement of</p>
<p>the Supporting Institutions of the Climate Action in Financial Institutions</p>
<p>Initiative was published (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.mainstreamingclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Joint-Statement-of-the-Climate-Action-in-Financial-Institutions-Initiative.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>here</strong></a>).

<blockquote>
<p>Rémy Rioux, CEO of the French Development</p>
<p>Agency (AFD) and Chairperson of the International Development Finance Club</p>
<p>(IDFC) stated the purpose quite eloquently: “Financial institutions play a</p>
<p>pivotal role in scaling up and directing investments and assets that are</p>
<p>necessary for transitioning to low-carbon, resilient economies. The integration</p>
<p>of climate considerations by the financial community at large, as promoted by</p>
<p>the Climate Action in Financial Institutions Initiative, is an absolute</p>
<p>necessity to reach the objectives of the Paris Agreement. In so doing, the</p>
<p>initiative’s Supporting Institutions are increasingly focusing on supporting</p>
<p>subnational and city-level actors, who are fundamental drivers of climate-smart</p>
<p>and sustainable development.”</p>

<h3>Give energy efficiency a chance</h3>


<p>This was a climate summit and, all too</p>
<p>often, energy efficiency is too quickly passed over. Good words are said but</p>
<p>the actions seldom follow.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s come home to Europe</strong>. We have a much</p>
<p>more complete package on sustainable energy that is in the final stages of</p>
<p>approval (although there are parts already approved). Energy efficiency is</p>
<p>considered one of the most cost-effective ways to mitigate greenhouse gas</p>
<p>emissions. And we certainly know that improved energy efficiency does much</p>
<p>more: improved competitiveness, more jobs, lower air pollution, health</p>
<p>benefits, lower costs and much more.</p>



<p><strong>Now we have to go from rhetoric to action</strong> –</p>
<p>just what the summit joint statement was stating. We also know there are many</p>
<p>potential projects to be designed, built and financed in all end-use sectors.</p>



<p><strong>Yet, we know there is a serious</strong></p>
<p><strong>underinvestment in energy efficiency.</strong> We have struggled over the years to</p>
<p>remove the blockages so that the market will work more effectively. Much of the</p>
<p>work relates to “de-risking” investments in energy efficiency.</p>



<p>In Europe, the Energy Efficiency Financial</p>
<p>Institutions Group (EEFIG) has provided two important tools to help the</p>
<p>financial community:&nbsp;</p>


<ul> 	<li><strong><strong>Firs</strong>t</strong>, there is the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://deep.eefig.eu/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>DEEP database</strong></a>, an open-source initiative to up-scale energy efficiency investments in Europe through the improved sharing and transparent analysis of existing projects in Buildings and Industry.&nbsp; To date there are over 10,000 projects in the database.</li> 	<li><strong>Second</strong>, EEFIG prepared the<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://eeip.webseiten.cc/ http://www.eefig.com/index.php/underwriting-toolkit"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong> Underwriting Toolkit</strong></a>. This Toolkit aims to assist financial institutions to scale up their deployment of capital into energy efficiency. Although the focus is on value and risk appraisal, additional material on the size of the potential market, methods of financing and the project life cycle have been included to give a fuller picture and help build capacity within financial institutions.</li> </ul>




<p>But there is more. It is well documented</p>
<p>that many energy efficiency measures are not undertaken because of a lack of</p>
<p>standardisation – of the process.&nbsp; Yes,</p>
<p>that process is the relationship between the asset owner (the business) and the</p>
<p>project developer (often an energy service company or an engineering firm).</p>



<p><strong>Right now the Investor Confidence Project,</strong></p>
<p><strong>a project funded by the European Commission, is trying to help that process,</strong></p>
<p><strong>bringing in the investor as well.</strong></p>



<p>There are many factors that influence</p>
<p>decisions and action. The Investor Confidence Project is there to remove many</p>
<p>of the complications and risks in improving the energy performance in industry,</p>
<p>street lighting and energy supply. ICP has developed – and is now testing – a</p>
<p>standardised approach.</p>


<h3>What others are saying</h3>


<p>Importantly, at a recent event, three</p>
<p>organisations that deliver energy efficiency projects came out in favour of the</p>
<p>approach taken by the Investor Confidence Project:</p>
<p><a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.gepenv.co.uk/energy/frameworks/refit-cymru"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>Re:fit Cymru</strong></a> is a framework for Energy Conservation Retrofits within Public Sector buildings</p>
<p>in Wales. They recently stated that “ICP protocols complement the existing technical &amp; compliance QA (quality assurance) checks and credibility</p>
<p>to the Payback Model and Guaranteed Savings and providing the contracting</p>
<p>Authority with due diligence / confidence.”&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore they said: “The Framework aligns closely with the ICP Protocols - this could even be improved</p>
<p>to further assist with IREE Certification of projects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amber Infrastructure Ltd is</p>
<p>managing the Mayor’s Energy Efficiency Fund in London and they provided this</p>
<p>summary of the benefits of ICP.</p>



<p>These are important voices that show the</p>
<p>benefits of the ICP approach.</p>


<h3>Join our Investor Network</h3>


<p>While we work with all stakeholders, investors</p>
<p>are key. The ICP Europe Investor Network is comprised of energy efficiency</p>
<p>investors who recognise the benefit of industry best practice and standardised</p>
<p>energy renovation project delivery. Members of the Network support the use of the ICP Protocols and</p>
<p>Credentialing System because these systems increase confidence in project</p>
<p>performance while reducing due diligence-related transaction costs.</p>



<p>You will see that this important step takes you</p>
<p>– and all of us – further along the path of action signalled by the Global</p>
<p>Climate Summit. We must be part of the solution.</p>

1170,"Local energy aggregation: Similarities between the Italian Hera Group and the Community Choice Energy programs in California",NULL,NULL,"<p>First published <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://energyindemand.com/2018/04/05/blog-from-silvia-zinetti-spring-thoughts-on-local-energy-aggregation-similarities-between-the-italian-hera-group-and-the-community-choice-energy-programs-in-california/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the past two articles, I analyzed several aspects of the Hera Group, its strong dedication to sustainable development, and how the company is advancing energy efficiency in industry. There is one more thing I would like to mention and in particular Hera's organizational structure and some common features with the Community Choice Energy (CCE) programs in California, also known as Community Choice Aggregation (CCA). For this purpose, I will explore data from Marin Clean Energy (MCE), which I introduced in previous articles as the subject of my research.</p>
<h3>First aggregation experiment in Italy and in California</h3>
<p>The Hera Group was born from the aggregation of eleven municipal companies in the Emilia Romagna region in Italy and has since grown with the incorporation of other companies in other neighboring regions. It is the first corporation of this kind and thus the first experiment of municipal aggregation in Italy. Marin Clean Energy was born from the aggregation of the electricity needs of cities and towns in Marin County, California, and has since expanded its operation to neighboring cities and Counties. It is the first Community Choice Aggregation program in the State of California.</p>
<h3>Municipalities as part of the organization governance</h3>
<p>Hera is a joint stock company, with the majority publicly owned. The shareholder structure is characterized by the presence of several municipalities in the reference territory and a private shareholding spread[i]. MCE is a non-profit agency, in the form of a Joint Power Authority[ii]. The Board of Directors includes elected city and county officials representing each of the communities that MCE serves[iii].</p>
<h3>Strong Local Roots</h3>
<p>Hera maintains a strong relationship with its customers through the group companies and territorial operating structures. In 2013 Hera started a new project, the ""HeraLab"", to increase its presence on the territory and strengthen its relationship with the local communities[iv]. MCE has strong collaborations with local partners and maintains an open dialogue with its communities. In 2014, MCE formed a Community Power Coalition, a partnership with community and grassroots policy advocacy organizations working on sustainability, environmental justice, and low-income issue[v].</p>
<h3>Competition</h3>
<p>Hera faces strong competition between operators in the energy sector as it operates in the Italian liberalized retail market. The company developed a successful business model based on a multi-business growth strategy, focusing on quality, cost reduction, innovation, sustainability and shared value, and a close relationship with its territory. MCE performs its services in a regulated retail market and faces strong competition from the incumbent utility, as customers can opt out from the program at any time. MCE was created to give a choice to the customers and its business strategy focuses on local sustainable development, electricity cost reduction, and close relationship with the community.</p>
<h3>Renewable energy in the electricity mix and future goals</h3>
<p>Hera's energy production comes for more than 70% from renewable and assimilated sources. Hera committed to power all Hera Spa activities in the Emilia-Romagna region with 100% renewable energy. MCE's electricity basic offer includes 55% of energy produced by renewable sources[vi]. MCE intends to gradually replace the conventional energy resources in its basic offer supply portfolio with an 80% renewable energy goal by 2025[vii].</p>
<h3>Promotion of energy efficiency</h3>
<p>Hera achieved a 2.6% reduction of the energy consumption compared to 2013, with a goal of 5% by 2020. MCE's long-term goal for energy efficiency programs in its service area is to reduce overall annual energy consumption by approximately 2%.</p>
<h3>Reduction of GHG emissions</h3>
<p>Hera's carbon footprint dropped by 10% for the energy production, with a target of 19% by 2020 compared to 2015. MCE's 2014 aggregate portfolio emission factor was approximately 26% lower than the incumbent utility. MCE's goal is to achieve a 100 % greenhouse gas-free supply portfolio by 2025[viii].</p>
<p>Points of reflections</p>
<p>Local energy aggregation seems to have positive results in the territories where Hera and MCE perform their services. Similarities between the two organizations include:</p>
<ul> 	<li>Hera and MCE were the first aggregation experiment, respectively in Italy and in California;</li> 	<li>The municipalities are part of the governing structure in both organizations;</li> 	<li>Both Hera and MCE have robust local roots and maintain a strong relationship with their clients and the territory;</li> 	<li>Both organizations face strong competitions while different market conditions. Their respective business strategy include among other, sustainable development, cost reduction, and close relationship with the territory;</li> 	<li>Both organizations are working towards common goals of increasing the use of renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions in a significant way.</li> </ul>
<p>Although different in nature, Hera is a multi-utility operating in the energy, environment, and water sector, while MCE is a public agency dealing with the procurement and generation of the electric power, both organizations are successful with their local energy aggregation business model and contribute to the sustainable development of their respective territory.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, there are lessons to be learned from both approaches.</p>

<p>Those who know me will know of my life long-love of aviation. I wanted to be a test pilot even before wanting to be an astronaut but ended up getting into energy. My under-graduate dissertation combined my two interests as it was on the use of hydrogen as an aviation fuel, an idea that was being heavily promoted in the late 1970s by Lockheed and others with a proposal to build hydrogen fuelled Tristars ferrying between the US, Europe and the Middle East. (This document is now online&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.slideshare.net/guidofawkes/hydrogen-a-future-aviation-fuel"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">here</a>). I gave up flying myself a few years ago and still miss it. <strong>As everyone knows aviation is a major problem in terms of emissions, with 500 million tonnes CO2&nbsp;a year expected to triple by 2050</strong>, and I do sometimes struggle to square the desire to minimise emissions and environmental impact and the need and desire to travel, especially with the amount of air travel I have done in the last five years.</p>
<p>To start with I don't think we can ever (or should try) suppress the basic human desire to travel. I actually think this is a reflection of the exploration drive, without which we would still be the arboreal primates or even the ocean dwelling mammals we are descended from.&nbsp; Likewise we should not constrain space exploration, in fact we should be doing more, it is just a fundamental human drive.&nbsp; Given that, plus all the conventional economic trends (i.e. increasing wealth leads to increasing travel), we will continue to see a growth in air travel with an increased environmental impact - if we don't change the technology.&nbsp;<strong> The question is how to change the technology and how quickly can we do it, especially in the safety driven culture and regulatory environment of aviation.</strong></p>
<p>A decade ago the emphasis was on bio-fuels and much capital was invested in biofuel production and trialling them in aircraft. Safety is of course critical in aviation and I always said I would rather not fly in a bio-fuelled aircraft for the first five years of its use (the same would apply to electric planes) - although that would have been different if I had become a test pilot! Clearly bio- and synthetic fuels will have a major role but the ultimate dream is electric power.<strong> Even a decade ago the idea of electric aircraft was science fiction but since then the advances in battery technology, coupled with the work of entrepreneurs and larger companies, has made the dream of electric aviation seem much closer.</strong></p>
<p>A recent article in AirSpaceMag.com described some of the developments including Eviation's nine passenger regional commuter plane that is supposed to fly in 2019 (which has the odd name of Alice). It shouldn't be a surprise, as we have seen the same thing in electric cars, but the choice of electric propulsion leads to significant changes in the way the rest of the aircraft is designed, both in terms of structure and layout. A lot of the structure of aircraft is designed to cope with the stresses of relatively heavy, vibrating engines. Electric motors are lighter but of course there is the huge weight of batteries which will account for 60% of Alices's total weight. For comparison fuel makes up c.48% of the weight of a fully laden Boeing 747. The range of the Alice is estimated at 650 miles at 275mph.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough the projected operating costs are low enough that the cost to passengers could be reduced by 30-60% compared to a conventional aircraft, savings being made in fuel and maintenance.&nbsp; Bonny Simi, President of JetBlue Technology Ventures, is quoted in the article as saying on short trips regional turboprops have an Available Seat Mile (ASM) cost of $0.15 to $0.20 with spikes above $0.40.&nbsp; Larger capacity, long haul jets have ASMs in the range of $0.08 to $0.12 as they fly higher where jets are more efficient and proportionately less time is spent in take-offs and climb.&nbsp; Simi goes onto say ""Forecasts for electric aircraft [flying] 300 to 700 miles estimate 10 to 12 cents"" ($0.10 to $0.12 per ASM). If that sort of cost advantage can actually be delivered the economic driver is clear.</p>
<p><strong>As everyone knows battery technology is improving rapidly and costs are falling.</strong> There is, however, a long way to go before larger aircraft could be electric. The ""magic number"" where long-distance flight can become viable is cited at 1,000 Wh/kg of battery weight whereas existing batteries are in the range of 270-300 Wh/kg. The battery in a Tesla S stores 85 kWh and weighs 540 kg - a specific energy of 157 Wh/kg. The target 1,000 Wh/kg for viable aircraft does not seem to take into account possible improvements in drag reduction (and possibly further advances in light weight structures). Professor Viswanathan from Carnegie Mellon University asserts that a battery producing 400-500 Wh/kg could propel an airplane 200 to 400 miles on a single charge.</p>
<p><strong>EasyJet has set a target to begin operating electric routes within 10 years and Norway has proposed making all flights less than 1.5 hours all electric by 2040.</strong> EasyJet has partnered with Wright Electric who are working on an aircraft that could carry 120 people on flights of 300 miles or less. Although these targets are exciting we should never forget both the hype cycle and the length of time (&amp; huge amount of money) it takes to get new aircraft certified for public operations. There is a long way, and lots of capital, between announcements and glossy websites and computer generated images and a flying, certified aircraft. As I highlighted in my under-graduate dissertation, it is not only the aircraft where you need to innovate and invest, the ground infrastructure would need to change considerably. When Terminal 5 was constructed it was designed with higher capacity ground power connections as the A-380 was coming into service, imagine the extra power capacity needed at airports for electric aircraft re-charging, as well as the operations impact because of the required charging time.</p>
<p><strong>At the larger, long-range end of the spectrum the direction of travel is towards hybrids. In 2008 Boeing introduced the concept SUGAR (Subsonic Ultra-Green Aircraft Research) Volt which has not been built. NASA is also working on hybrid concepts.</strong> At the Glenn Research Center the focus is on concepts that could carry 150 people long distances. As well as propulsion systems designs concepts include the highly efficient blended wing designs, a big departure from the tube designs we are familiar with. (I think it was low cost aviation pioneer Freddy Laker who said he was in the ""aluminium tubes"" business.) Blended wing designs can save 50% of fuel usage and NASA is moving towards funding a flying large-scale X-plane by 2021. In July 2018 at the Farnborough Air Show the UK Business Secretary Greg Clark announced a £343 million government and industry R&amp;D drive including £58m for electric flight.</p>
<blockquote><p>Aviation has always been incredibly innovative. Thirty three years separated the Wright Flyer and the DC-3, the first really effective air transport aircraft, thirty seven years separated the DC-3 and the Boeing 747 which significantly reduced cost and enabled the boom in international travel, forty years separate the Boeing 747 and the Boeing 787 which has a c.50% lower fuel burn. With all the research on innovations in aircraft design, engine design, electric propulsion and batteries it is clear that aircraft can continue to become much more efficient and ultimately much cleaner for the environment than they are today. The race is on between reducing emissions through higher efficiency and new propulsion technologies and increasing demand for air travel.</p>

<p>First published <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://energytransition.org/2018/07/is-an-energy-revolution-underway-in-chile/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a></p>
<p>Chile’s share of renewable energy has tripled in the past five years. Maximiliano Proaño takes a look at the policy behind this massive growth, and the road ahead.</p>
<p>In May, Chile’s former Energy Minister Maximo Pacheco presented his book called “Energy Revolution in Chile,” a summary of the country’s energy policy from 2014-2018. While it is true that important progress took place during this period, there are still many issues yet to be solved before talking about a true energy revolution.</p>
<p>The Chilean energy sector has experienced big changes in the last few years. Five years ago, Chile generated only 5% of its electricity from renewable energy sources. This percentage has more than tripled in the last years, reaching 18% in May 2018. This excludes big hydro-electric plants over 20 megawatts.</p>
<p>Before 2014, the Chilean energy context was complex: it was heavily affected by the gas supply disruption from Argentina, as well as serious and long drought periods. In addition, it was difficult to grant environmental permits and there was citizen opposition to big plant projects, as well as few changes on the generation side, and scarce investment in infrastructure both in the generation and power transmission areas.</p>
<p>In 2013, the average market prices of the two largest grid connections, the Central Interconnected Grid (Sistema Interconectado Central, SIC) amounted to approximately US$ 112/MWh, while in the Great Northern Interconnected Grid (Sistema Interconectado Central del Norte Grande, SING), it reached US$ 108/MWh. Since November 2017, SIC and SING are interconnected as Sistema Eléctrico Nacional, SEN. As such, Chilean industry faced one of the highest electricity prices in all of Latin America.</p>

<p>By contrast, in May 2018, 18% of the Chilean electricity was generated by renewable energy equivalent to 4134 MW. The breakdown of that percentage is: 8% solar PV, 6% on-shore wind, 2% biomass and 2% small-hydroelectric plants (less than 20 MW).</p>

<p>Furthermore, <a href=""https://www.pv-magazine.com/2017/11/03/chiles-auction-concludes-with-average-price-of-32-5mwh/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">energy auctions</a> obtained a 75% lower price in 2017 than in 2013, at an average price of $32.5 MWh. It is this fast growth in the usage of renewable energy that has been celebrated by energy agencies, international press and environmental leaders alike such as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnXhTggl3RE"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Al Gore, who defined it as great policy</a>.</p>

<h3>What were the reasons for this massive growth?</h3>
<p><strong>Prices:</strong> According to the IRENA Report <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2018/Jan/IRENA_2017_Power_Costs_2018.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">“Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2017”</a>, the installed costs of utility-scale solar PV projects fell by 68% (73% with LCoE methodology) between 2010 and 2017. The total installed costs of newly commissioned CSP projects fell by 27% (33% with LCoE methodology) in 2010-2017. Installed costs for newly commissioned onshore wind projects fell by 20% (22% with LCoE methodology). For offshore wind, the total installed costs fell by 2%(13% with LCoE methodology) over the same period.</p>
<p><strong>Solar and wind potential:</strong> Chile has an enormous potential for the development of renewable energy, including more than 1865000 MW for wind power, solar and hydraulic projects. The Atacama Desert has some of the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.nature.com/articles/srep22457"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">highest levels of solar radiation </a>in the world.</p>
<p><strong>A Public Policy:</strong> The Chilean government has developed a long-term energy public policy, the <a href=""http://www.minenergia.cl/archivos_bajar/Documentos/Agenda_Energetica/Agenda_de_Energia-Documento_Completo_Ingles.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Energy Agenda 2050</a>. It was presented in 2014, including goals, a new role for the public sector, a CO2 tax, and an abundant legislative agenda.</p>
<p><strong>Auctions:</strong> The Chilean auction structure has been called a <a href=""http://carlosstjames.com/renewable-energy/chiles-creativity-comes-to-the-fore-in-its-2017-energy-auctions/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">marvel of creativity</a>. They were separated in two blocks defined by time: hourly and quarterly. While the auction is officially technology neutral, it is set up in ways that favor certain technologies, notably solar (in the hourly-segmented 24-hour block) as well as hydro and wind (in the seasonally-adjusted quarterly blocks). It allows intermittent technologies to maximize their potential without having to incorporate a still-expensive storage component.</p>
<p><strong>The fast deployment of renewable energy definitely has several positive effects, especially fighting climate change and increasing energy security. But all that glitters is not gold.</strong></p>
<p>The institutional changes for the energy sector in Chile, such as energy auctions, were directed only towards big companies. While the installed capacity of the Chilean electricity system is 22531 MW, the distributed energy – through a net billing system – was only 18.3 MW in May 2018.</p>
<p>Energy generation cooperatives are almost non-existent in Chile. The main reasons for why the deployment of renewable energy has been so difficult in Chile and not resulted in greater citizen participation are because there are not suitable public policies nor incentives, for instance, feed-in tariffs and net metering systems in place. There is also a lack of specific regulation for energy cooperatives to foster their foundation and operation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chile is still behind in reaching its energy efficiency goal as part of the Energy Agenda 2050. The government failed to present law initiatives to tackle this subject, with no relevant achievements in the matter. First, under the 20/25 goal the Energy Agenda 2050 considers that in 2025 a set of measures will allow to reduce by 20% our energy consumption compared to the estimated energy consumption in a similar situation without these measures.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, ever since its introduction in 2014, the goal 20/25 has never really been monitored, lacking any insight of the supposed reduction of Chilean energy consumption. Other important announcement was the goal for energy efficiency translated to state policy, also the Energy Efficiency Law. This project, regrettably, was never presented by the Chilean government.</p>
<p><strong>Hence, it is too early to say that Chile has achieved an energy revolution throughout the last few years. </strong>While about 66% of the energy capacity is still generated from fossil sources (gas, carbon and diesel), less than 0.1% of the electrical matrix is generated from citizen energy, and Chile lacks of a successful public policy in energy efficiency.</p>
<p>It is possible that Chile has begun an energy transition process. In that case, the focus should now be set on citizen energy and energy efficiency. It is now up to the government to plan appropriate policy, and to civil society to demand change and take advantage of new opportunities.</p>

1174,"Using Non-Energy Benefits to Build Better Business Cases",NULL,NULL,"
<p>First published <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.onlyelevenpercent.com/using-non-energy-benefits-to-build-better-business-cases/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a>.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I wrote about the need for better business cases for energy efficiency projects.<strong> More and more it seems that one of the most effective ways of building better business cases is to identify and value non-energy benefits (NEBs).</strong> NEBs are all those benefits that come from an efficiency project that are not energy related, they can include (amongst many others); improved health, reduced absenteeism, better learning outcomes, increased productivity, increased production, and increased asset value. All of these benefits have been identified in specific situations and in most if not all cases have been measured.</p>
<p>The first useful thing about NEBs is that they are usually much more strategic and interesting to decision makers (at all levels from consumers to CFOs) than simple energy cost savings (or even reduction in emissions). This is important because the classical capital allocation model which says that companies should invest in any project that has an IRR greater than the cost of capital just is not how it works in practice. Capital is limited and projects that are considered strategic have higher priority than non-strategic projects. If something is strategic it would be unusual to hear “what is the payback?”. It is strategic because it supports the primary mission of the organisation whatever that is and it is something that usually “has to be done”.</p>
<p>The second thing about NEBs is that they really do have financial value and once they are identified their value can be measured or at least estimated. It has been said that they are hard to measure and sometimes that is true but the reality is that data that can be used to estimate benefits often exists already e.g. absenteeism records. It is just that traditionally energy managers or energy efficiency engineers have not considered the NEBs and their value in their business cases, or gathered data to support the business case. Valuing NEBs is not an exact science but that applies to many things in business, the point is to recognise that they exist and to come up with an agreed estimate of value – however approximate. Once you do that you can often find that the value of the NEBs is far more than the value of the energy cost savings.</p>
<h3>So to make better business cases</h3>
<ul> 	<li>Step 1: identify EE project and energy cost savings</li> 	<li>Step 2: identify NEBs</li> 	<li>Step 3: link the NEBs to strategic direction i.e. create strategic value</li> 	<li>Step 4: appraise financial value of NEBs and include in financial evaluation alongside energy cost savings</li> 	<li>Step 5: capture strategic &amp; financial value and include in the business case</li> </ul>
<h3>To sum up</h3>
<p>Financial value of EE + Strategic value of NEBs + Financial value of NEBs = Better Business Cases = More Capital Flow</p>

1175,"Batteries included: Gigafactories advance German energy transition",NULL,NULL,"<p>First published <strong><a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://energytransition.org/2018/07/batteries-included-gigafactories-advance-german-energy-transition/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Wind farms connected to batteries can help Germany go fossil-free (Photo by&nbsp;<a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Uetersen_Ochsenweg_Windpark_01.jpg"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Frank Schwichtenberg</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">CC BY 3.</a>0)</p>
<p>Energy storage is going to be a huge industry in the transition to renewables, and European countries and producers are moving in on batteries. This is Germany’s chance to bring stable jobs to its former mining regions, and finally phase out coal. L. Michael Buchsbaum takes a look.</p>
<p>This June, Europe’s largest battery came online: a whopping 50MWh in Jarelund, Germany. Built by NEC ES, the “EnspireMe” battery is a joint venture between the Dutch renewables company Eneco and Mitsubishi Corporation. It’s connected to regional wind farms and allows power stored in the batteries to either be sold into Germany’s reserve markets where it provides balancing and grid stabilization, or directly into the grid where it can compete against coal and gas.</p>
<p>Comprised of 10,000 lithium-ion batteries, the project further demonstrates “the economic benefits of pairing energy storage with renewables, first proven with solar and now with the abundant wind generators in the Jardelund region,” said NEC ES CEO Steve Fludder at the commissioning.</p>
<p>While Tesla’s 100MWh battery in Australia remains the world’s largest, giant battery projects are being announced daily—especially as more renewables come online. Ever-larger storage systems are key for balancing out wind and solar energy arrays. Their growing role in the energy mix reinforces the call for the development of a European-built next-generation battery industry.</p>
<p>Envisioned as a win-win situation, in October the European Commission established <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/policy/european-battery-alliance_en"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">the European Battery Alliance (EBA)</a>. The alliance should encourage investors and companies to help power a nascent electric car industry, supply the evolving energy grid and generate thousands of high paying, high-tech jobs.</p>
<p>Now several companies, including Tesla, are reportedly taking steps to construct vast so-called “gigafactories” throughout the continent. And ahead of its first meeting, Germany’s new Coal Commission (<a href=""https://energytransition.org/2018/06/mixed-mandate-germanys-new-coal-commission-struggles-to-balance-environment-and-jobs/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">tasked with phasing out coal while helping affected workers</a>) cited green-battery factories as a viable solution to replacing jobs and revenue as fossil fuels are eliminated.</p>
<p>At June’s Intersolar conference in Munich, Maroš Šefcovic (EC vice president for energy) <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.neweurope.eu/article/eu-made-batteries-crucial-integration-renewables-europe/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">spoke passionately</a> about establishing a European-wide, battery-centered private-public partnership, similar to the way aircraft manufacturer Airbus was created. He called for the European Commission to hammer out regulatory schemes and develop standardization protocols to help member states lure battery producers and investors, and sweetened the offer by vowing to step up EU research and innovation “to better link it with industry’s future needs.” Immediately available through 2019 are €110 million for battery-related research and innovation projects. And from now through 2020, developers can tap into “a budget of €2.7 billion available under the European Innovation Council for potential breakthrough projects and batteries,” he said.</p>
<p>While the EC’s Renewable Energy Directive played a key role in persuading EU member states to install the more than 100GW of Photovoltaic (PV) capacity now generating energy today, Šefcovic lamented that Europe failed to create enough support for manufacturing across the whole value chain. Commenting on European PV makers’ general loss of market share “to our competitors,” he’s determined not to make the same mistake with batteries.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We want to be a global trendsetter. This should cover the entire value chain from the sustainable supply of raw materials, through production to recycling. This and next year, we will be in close contact with the European standardization bodies in order to develop European standards – the green label,” Šefcovic said.</p>
<p>According to some bullish forecasts, Europe could capture a battery market of up to €250 billion a year from 2025 onwards. Under these scenarios, covering EU demand alone could require between 10 and 20 gigafactories and major production centers. Electric car leader Tesla is seemingly close to making a major European investment announcement soon. <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-europe-gigafactory/teslas-musk-says-germany-a-front-runner-for-europe-gigafactory-idUSKBN1JG1EJ"">In a mid-June Tweet</a>, CEO Elon Musk wrote that “Germany is a leading choice for Europe. Perhaps on the German-French border makes sense, near the Benelux countries.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Another potential developer, consortium TerraE, is purportedly planning to launch battery production in 2019 and have two plants with a total capacity of 34 gigawatts running by 2028. The Swedish startup, Northvolt, led by former Tesla executive Peter Carlsson, aims to produce batteries with 32 gigawatt-hour capacity by 2023. It has already attracted a €10 million investment from VW’s truck subsidiary Scania, and just received approval from the European Investment Bank (EIB) for a €52.5 million loan for a demonstration battery production plant. Plans call for the construction of a gigafactory in northern Sweden with companies like Vattenfall, ABB and Siemens having a presence there too.</p>
<p>If these plans succeed, Europe could become the hub of battery production, creating jobs and a better life for those in regions left behind by the shift away from coal. Ahead of Germany’s Coal Commission’s first meeting, <a href=""https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article178051188/Gigafactories-sollen-Kohle-Kumpeln-neue-Jobs-bringen.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">word leaked that they too are focusing on luring battery producers to coal dependent areas</a> where some 100,000 or more jobs hang in the balance.</p>

<table summary=""""> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""409"" height=""783"" src=""fileadmin/_processed_/9/2/csm_4d506dd615_2619ffeab9.png"" width=""1020"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p>If battery production begins in Germany, renewable jobs could replace coal jobs altogether</p>
<p>Former mine sites, as well as nuclear and coal-fired power plants, are inherently suitable for redevelopment as gigafactories: they are already electrical grid and transportation hub and have a population eager for stable jobs. Supporting the growth of green e-battery “gigaproduction” centers could provide an elegant, high-tech solution for Germany and Europe, as well as a model for others worldwide.</p>

<p>In recent years there has been a shift in emphasis in financing energy efficiency measures towards de-risking projects. This is to help all stakeholders from asset owners to project developers to the investor community.</p>
<p>One such effort, funded through the European Commission is the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://eeip.webseiten.cc/ http://europe.eeperformance.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Investor Confidence Project</a>. While it has been mentioned in previous issues of Energy Efficiency in Business and Industry, it is worth explaining a bit more because the project is in the phase leading up to full market deployment.</p>
<p>In only a few years, the Investor Confidence Project has made significant progress in Europe. While it began several years ago with a focus on improving energy efficiency project development and financing in the buildings sector, since May 2017 it has focused on industry and specific aspects of infrastructure – namely street lighting and some elements of district energy.</p>
<p>While the name is well known, there is still some confusion on what it is designed to achieve and how it is developing for the European market.</p>
<p>Importantly, there are good market opportunities for project developers to increase their offerings to clients and thus to increase turnover. <strong>However, to participate in ICP, some fairly simple steps need to be followed so that you, as a project developer – whether you are an energy service company or an engineering or auditing company – can follow our methodology so that your projects can be accredited under our approach</strong>. The first step is to have our training so that you can be credentialed.</p>
<p>Let us look at the key elements of the Investor Confidence Project and why there is a need for more project developers to be credentialed under our system.</p>
<h3>One step at a time</h3>

<p><strong>The Investor Confidence Project Europe unlocks access to financing for the building, industry, district energy and street lighting markets by standardising how energy efficiency projects are developed, documented and measured. </strong></p>
<p>ICP's Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ (IREE™) is an international certification that insures best practices, the right professionals and third-party validation are used to deliver high-quality projects that you can bank on.</p>
<p>The IREE™ certification is based on the ICP framework, which assembles best practices and existing technical standards into a set of Protocols that define a clear roadmap for developing projects, determining savings estimates, and documenting and verifying results.</p>
<p>The ICP Protocols are now available on the<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/protocols.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""> ICP website</a>. These Protocols will soon be available in selected languages.</p>
<p>The certification training for project developers will follow this process and to have a better understanding the Protocols, which form the basis of the relationship between the project developer and the asset owner. They also form the basis for the third-party quality assurance</p>
<p>Everything is described in the Protocols and the Project Development Specifications. The PDS provides a clear roadmap for Project Developers to correctly implement each requirement specified in the ICP protocols based on current best practices and available industry resources. It represents the collective project development knowledge of a large team of industry experts and has been designed to allow various stakeholders to develop projects that meet a consistent level of quality and conform to the ICP Protocols. As with all of ICP's offerings the PDS is a living document and ICP seeks the continuing input of all stakeholders.</p>

<h3>Benefits of IREE™</h3>

<ul> 	<li>Owners get a standard they can use to source energy efficiency projects they can believe in</li> 	<li>Investors achieve reduced due diligence costs thanks to third-party review of each project before certification</li> 	<li>Standardised approach to developing projects enables aggregation of projects into high performance portfolios</li> </ul>
<p>By streamlining transactions and increasing the reliability of projected energy savings, ICP Europe is creating a marketplace for standardised energy efficiency projects. Individual projects can then be aggregated and traded by institutional investors on secondary markets – just like mortgages or other asset-backed securities.</p>
<h3>What ICP brings to you</h3>
<p>This is an excellent market opportunity that will only grow over time. It is well appreciated that more standardisation in the project process is required if investments are to be at a level that comes close to closing the gap between business as usual and the potential identified through the audits and other analyses.</p>
<p>ICP is still relatively new and it needs project developers to join into the system and for many of them to go one step further and play a role in quality assurance. It takes two hours to attend our required training for industry (and energy supply) or for street lighting.</p>
<p>The requirements to be a member of the ICP Project Developer Network is available <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/join-the-icp-project-developer-network.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a>.

<p>When it comes to integrating the latest technologies and efficiencies into a facility, nothing provides a cleaner slate to work with than a new facility. But in too many cases, utility new construction programs only consider energy efficiency (EE) when providing incentives for new construction; such things as demand response and renewable energy are siloed – leaving a lot of untapped opportunities (and money) on the table for utilities and their customers.</p>
<p>With both buildings and the electric grid going through transformative changes in this new century – requiring them to become more ‘<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://blogs.dnvgl.com/energy/can-smart-zne-address-feeder-hotspots"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">smart</a>’ and <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://blogs.dnvgl.com/energy/buildings-are-for-people-engaging-occupants-on-resilience"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">resilient</a> – utilities have the opportunity to start thinking more strategically. <strong>Clearly, the design and construction phases of a new building provide the most cost-effective opportunity for both utilities and building owners to invest in resiliency, grid inter-connectedness, efficiency, and smart systems.</strong></p>
<p>But going forward, <strong>utility new construction programs will need to go beyond just EE</strong>, and look at what type and how many electric vehicle chargers should be incorporated, how much solar should be on the roof, what type and size battery the building should have, and how these systems and other smart devices within the building best integrate with the grid.</p>
<p><a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.energycodes.gov/development/determinations"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">With energy codes becoming stricter</a> and LED lighting and controls becoming code-required, it will become increasingly difficult to rely on prescriptive and even custom measures to achieve program goals. <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://blogs.dnvgl.com/energy/2018-energy-trends-connected-lighting-is-the-future"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">There currently is no available lighting technology that is more cost effective and efficient</a> than LEDs, and likely won’t be anytime soon. Likewise, with certain HVAC and chiller measures, some of the code baselines have become so efficient that manufacturers are having difficulty making code-compliant equipment, let alone anything more efficient than code.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What if the goal of new construction programs is changed from incenting energy savings to incenting buildings to stay below relevant kWh consumption thresholds? What if the goal promotes resiliency and grid-integration technologies?</em> Though the regulatory environments are not yet set up to easily allow these changes, they seem like the next logical step for the industry.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>By looking at kWh consumption limits instead of kWh savings, the focus can be expanded from simple EE savings to defining the most optimum operating limits for a dynamic, networked system</strong>. These kWh consumption levels could be climate-zone and industry-specific, and the on-site storage and renewable energy systems and other grid-connected or networked systems, could then be optimized based on the needs of the grid.</p>
<p>So how do we get there? Running small-scale pilots is a good way to begin, and several forward-thinking utilities already are paving the way.

1178,"The EIP-SCC Matchmaking initiative as a tool to accelerate investments in the Smart City Panorama",NULL,NULL,"<p><em>Project Initiatives presentation at the 'Explore' zone at the Sofia EIP-SCC Matchmaking on 27-28 June 2018</em></p>
<p>As urban population increases but budgets are tight, the pressure for cities is now high. They need to turn quickly into smart cities, which means improving services and infrastructures for a better quality of urban life. Smart cities have featured in the European policy landscape since 2012, when the <strong>European Commission launched the European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities (EIP-SCC)</strong>. This Partnership is now becoming a major market-changing undertaking bringing together cities, industries, SMEs, investors, researchers and other smart city actors. To better promote social and economic sustainability in cities across the European Union, during the General Assembly of June 2018, the EIP-SCC launched a new initiative: an onsite matchmaking programme to stimulate civic improvements by bringing together cities, industry representatives and motivated investors.</p>
<h3>What is the Matchmaking?</h3>

<p>The <strong>matchmaking is designed to facilitate interactions between urban developers of smart initiatives on one side and the financial sector on the other, through one-to-one discussions</strong>. In this programme, smart city project promoters are at the core of smart urban development plans and often are the players that bear the costs of such projects. Through the matchmaking process, promoters can learn from the beginning about the opportunities to receive financial support and they become aware of all the conditions that financial institutions apply. Additionally, promoters can obtain productive feedback on their projects and can be supported in the identification and management of key risks. In other words, the matchmaking aims at giving participants a chance to create long-term relationships that can ultimately lead to actual financial support to the project. On the financiers’ side, this programme is a great occasion to expand investment opportunities and a way to get in touch with relevant players in the smart city project panorama. It allows investors to support projects from their very beginning and enables them to choose the ones that fully meet the standards set by those investors.</p>

<p><em>in the EIP-SCC Matchmaking on 27-28 June 2018</em></p>

<h3>What is the challenge being faced by project promoters?</h3>

<p>At the current stage, two main problems are constraining the realisations of new projects in Europe. Firstly, projects are frequantly<strong> developed<strong> </strong></strong><strong>without sufficient consideration to the financial aspects</strong> from the early design phase which often leads to failure and public authorities can rarely intervene. This is due to financial constraints that usually make it either not possible or less efficient for public entities to sustain the investment cost of smart city projects with public debt only. Investments usually require high upfront capital expenditures, which would require diverting resources from other expenditures that municipalities have to sustain.</p>
<p>Secondly, despite the availability of EU funds being quite high now, a rather limited number of projects are eligible for funding. That is mainly due to three reasons:<strong> lack of standardisation</strong> in project presentation, <strong>uncertainty about returns on investment</strong> and mismatch between projects’ size (usually very small) and available funds.</p>
<p>In this regard, the matchmaking becomes the right place where projects that are currently being designed can be unveiled to several financiers and eventually meet the right investor. Financial institutions involved can play a key role for several reasons. They can anticipate economic resources in exchange for a long-term repayment schedule. They may be aware of schemes and opportunities to have private capital sustaining entirely or in part such cost (i.e. a pension fund involved in the matchmaking has just applied this business case for smart lighting in even small municipalities). In some cases, financiers can also choose to make a direct investment in the project (i.e. equity or quasi-equity), therefore bearing some of the costs themselves and not simply anticipating them.</p>
<p>It is clear that the range of opportunities is indeed very vast, and, most importantly, the matchmaking enables the creation of relationships between project promoters and financial institutions that can accompany the development of the project until its actual implementation, ensuring successful financial support.</p>

<h3>An answer to the challenge – ICP</h3>
<p>To further improve the matchmaking and to support project promoters and investors to solve the challenges identified, the EIP-SCC has started to collaborate with the Investor Confidence Project (ICP).</p>
<p>The ICP is addressing the lack of standardisation and linked uncertainty about returns by providing protocols to standardise the project development process. These protocols, covering buildings, street lighting, energy supply and industry, are developed by European experts and equip project promoters with a best practice-based process alongside the entire project. From baselining to measurement and verification. Finally, a vetted 3rd party certifies correct application providing the IREETM (Investor Ready Energy Efficiency) Certification.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two key benefits for project promoters to use the ICP protocols</strong>:</p>
<ol> 	<li>Access to the ICP investor network representing 1,4 billion EURO</li> 	<li>Trust amongst their clients, the cities, that projects will deliver against promises</li> </ol>
<p>And there is free training and even free certification available until mid-2019 (ICP is an EU funded project under the H2020 programme. Representatives from ICP will join EIP-SCC for the entire three days in Barcelona to explain the concept in more detail and to support EIP-SCCs matchmaking programme.</p>
<h3>More investment in urban projects in Europe</h3>
<p>The 2018 General Assembly provided a unique opportunity for smart city actors to meet, network, learn, shape views, develop plans, exchange best practices, present projects, find partners, and stimulate discussions to help achieve the ambitious goal of reaching €1 billion worth of smart city project investments in 300 European cities by 2020.</p>
<p>We are confident that our next event will result in an even greater success. <strong>It will take place during the Smart City Expo World Congress (SCEWC) of Barcelona in November 2018.</strong> The SCEWC is the perfect occasion to facilitate business interaction among smart city project developers and investors because it always succeeds in attracting thousands of smart city actors over the course of a few days' conference.</p>

<p>The Investor Confidence Project (ICP) has developed protocols that enable standardisation of documents and processes for energy efficiency projects. The protocols make projects bankable for investors, which in turn enables aggregation of projects to unlock vast pools of capital to flow into energy efficiency projects. But how does this work in detail?Here are answers to specific questions, from understanding the protocols to the benefits for industry, district energy and street lighting</p>

1180,"It's time to act",NULL,NULL,"<blockquote><p><em>People only accept change when they are faced with necessity, and only recognise necessity when a crisis is upon them. -Jean Monnet. French political economist and diplomat who was one of the founding fathers of the European Union</em></p></blockquote>
<p>There has been recent news about the latest findings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It concluded that the impact of global climate change is more severe than we have been willing to admit. For many of us, we knew this crunch day would come because the evidence has been stacking up for years. This summer was a good example that raised the concerns in all of us.</p>
<p>Let us take stock and start taking the necessary steps forward.</p>
<h3>Avoiding a crisis</h3>
<p>I started working at the International Energy Agency in the early 1980s, working in the energy efficiency group. It was in the directorate for long-term co-operation. Energy efficiency was promoted as a long-term approach to avoid crises. Remember we had gone through two oil crises in the 1970s, at great cost to our economies.</p>
<p>To be truthful, it was hard to convince governments and individuals to take actions to improve energy efficiency because of a possible energy security crisis some time in the future. Then in the early 1990s, the first discussions on climate change were taking place amongst governments and energy efficiency was seen as a useful tool to address the growing concerns. In fact, Denmark and the Netherlands were the first countries to re-direct their energy efficiency strategies towards addressing climate change. Yet, there is the same concern as after the oil crises. The adverse effects of climate change seemed so far in the future.</p>
<p>We are not saying that now.</p>
<h3>Take a deep breath</h3>
<p>Following the publication of the IPCC report on October 8th, it has been interesting to see how it has been handled in the media. Everyone has been running around trying to figure out what we can do – now. Yes, we can’t complain that we should have done more yesterday.</p>
<p>But we do have to take a deep breath and think thoughtfully of our next steps. We also need to think about what is available to help us now.</p>
<h3>Some lessons we’ve learned</h3>
<p>We have gained a lot of experience since those first steps after the oil crises of the 1970s. We are now in much better shape to take effective action – if there is the will and commitment to do so.</p>
<p>Let’s just list a few of those lessons learned:</p>
<ul> 	<li>There are more technologies available to help you reduce your energy consumption and the prices are coming down. Also, there are many new innovations coming forward all the time.</li> 	<li>There are now more services to help you. The growth of energy service companies has helped. More engineering companies are offering related services and audits are more readily available.</li> 	<li>National and regional energy agencies are providing more and more services to help consumers in all sectors. Check out agencies near you <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://enr-network.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a></li> 	<li>Everyone is working towards providing ways to help you finance energy efficiency measures. These include efforts to “de-risk” energy efficiency projects in order to give more confidence to investors – including you.</li> 	<li>There are efforts to improve the regulatory framework to support efforts in energy efficiency.</li> </ul>
<p>It is on these last two points that I would like to say a bit more.</p>
<h3>Financing energy efficiency</h3>
<p>While energy efficiency measures to implement are identified, financing them is not always so simple. Yes, there are some low-cost/no-cost measures you can do but they are not sufficient for meeting our long-term goals – and your own business needs.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the European Commission together with an initiative of the UN Environment Programme has brought financial institutions together with other relevant stakeholders to discuss how the financing system can be improved. There were many recommendations from better policies, better transparency of data and information, and improved capacity in financial institutions. The Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (<a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.eefig.com/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">EEFIG</a>) developed two tools that are a start.</p>
<ul> 	<li>First there is an <a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.eefig.com/index.php/underwriting-toolkit"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Underwriting Toolkit</a> designed to assist financial institutions to scale up their deployment of capital into energy efficiency. This is to help those financial institutions understand, analyse and finance energy efficiency projects.</li> 	<li>Second, there is the De-Risking Energy Efficiency Platform (<a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://deep.eefig.eu/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">DEEP</a>), an open-source initiative to up-scale energy efficiency investments in Europe through the improved sharing and transparent analysis of existing projects in Buildings and Industry. There are now more than 10,000 projects in that database. It will soon be expanding to even more.</li> </ul>
<p>There are other initiatives such as the Investor Confidence Project, of which I have written much on. ICP unlocks access to financing for the building, industry, district energy and street lighting markets by standardising how energy efficiency projects are developed, documented and measured. To know more, go to the <a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/articles/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">EEIP website</a> and filter for my name, Rod Janssen.</p>
<h3>Ensuring the regulatory framework is appropriate and robust</h3>
<p>The European Committee for Standardization, <a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.cen.eu/Pages/default.aspx"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">CEN</a>, is increasingly active to support energy efficiency. In energy efficiency and energy management, there are standards for appliances (Ecodesign), energy labelling, energy management (including energy audits), smart grids and smart meters. There is quite a range of standards related to improving the energy performance of buildings. They are exploring how standards can be used for financing, showing interest in such projects as ICP mentioned above.</p>
<p>CEN has recently started work to see how standards can be more appropriate to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>
<h3>Finally</h3>
<p>The examples shown above are there to show you are not alone. There are many efforts underway to ensure that our economies and our consumers (yes, you) are better prepared for the future and are contributing towards a more sustainable environment. Remember, energy efficiency is there to help you. It is a means to an end and not an end in itself. It is a policy tool to help solve your problems.</p>

<p>In recent years there has been a shift in emphasis in financing energy efficiency measures towards de-risking projects. This is to help all stakeholders from asset owners to project developers to the investor community.</p>
<p>One such effort, funded through the European Commission is the&nbsp;<a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Investor Confidence Project</a>. While it has been mentioned in previous issues of Energy Efficiency in Business and Industry, it is worth explaining a bit more because the project is in the phase leading up to full market deployment.</p>

1181,"Ireland’s new Renewable Energy Support Scheme (RESS) design",NULL,NULL,"<p>First published <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://blogs.dnvgl.com/energy/irelands-new-renewable-energy-support-scheme-ress-design"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a>.</p>
<h3>What does it mean for the renewable industry in Ireland?</h3>
<p>On Tuesday 24th&nbsp;July, the Government of the Republic of Ireland approved the design of the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). This long-awaited&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.dccae.gov.ie/documents/RESS%20Design%20Paper.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">decision</a>&nbsp;has provided some clarity about the scale of the government’s ambition and the potential future makeup of the Irish renewable industry out to 2030.</p>
<h3>Auction design</h3>
<p>The new RESS will consist of a series of regular auctions scheduled at frequent intervals. Renewable capacity, which is auctioned will be defined in terms of GWhrs and not by MW installed. The government has estimated that approximately 11-12 TWhrs of additional generation (4,500 MW of onshore wind equivalent) will be required to meet the 2030 electricity from renewable sources (RES-E) target of 55%.</p>
<p>Importantly, a potential&nbsp;roadmap is provided in the RESS design paper outlining the frequency and makeup of the future potential auctions.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""size-full wp-image-7080 aligncenter"" height=""192"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/625379621b.png"" width=""662"" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""416"" style="""" /></p>
<p>The inclusion of this potential roadmap will help developers of onshore wind, solar and offshore wind projects to start planning immediately for their bid strategies in RESS.</p>
<p>Participation by a specific technology will be subject to a three year ‘viability gap’ look back analysis prior to each auction, to ensure technologies that no longer require a subsidy are ineligible. Also, only those technologies with overlapping viability gaps will be allowed to participate in each auction. An Administrative Strike Price or bid ceiling price will likely be set for each technology.</p>
<p>The stated aim of the RESS design is to have technology neutral auctions. However, the use of potential&nbsp;targeted intervention levers&nbsp;to achieve specific policy objectives for each auction round is mentioned in the document. Some of the notable levers specified are:</p>
<h3>Target delivery dates</h3>
<p>The target delivery refers to the dates by which a renewable generation project seeking support must be connected and energised. Projects that fail to meet their delivery dates will forfeit their bid bonds and may be excluded from future auction rounds. Target delivery dates are currently expected to be used in the first two auction rounds, RESS 1 and 2.</p>
<p>The requirement for all projects participating in RESS 1 to be connected and energized by the end of 2020 is expected to open this auction to solar even though it currently has a higher LCOE than onshore wind. This is because the technology can be installed quickly (in a few months) and some onshore wind projects may struggle to achieve this delivery date or find lenders comfortable with the tight deadline. A key influence for projects bidding will be the definition of ‘connected and energized projects’. Is this defined as a whole facility online or just a proportion? Consideration of how grid connection delays (through no fault of the developer) may impact the delivery date should also be considered in the detailed rule set.</p>
<h3>Placing a cap on single technology&nbsp;within an auction</h3>
<p>Limiting the amount of capacity one technology can win in an auction would enable the remaining capacity to be allocated to other technologies on a price basis, where prices are set to be within a certain range, e.g. 15% of the (single technology) clearing price. This lever is currently proposed in RESS 2 and possibly further auctions, indicating the government’s desire to expand the diversity of the renewable technology base.</p>
<p>The inclusion of this cap in the RESS 2 auction is likely to provide a further opportunity for solar to compete with onshore wind. For offshore wind, ongoing issues with the consenting, licencing and grid connection, and the early auction and delivery dates of 2020 &amp; 2022 respectively, may limit most offshore projects’ ability to participate in the RESS 2 auction. It is likely that the most realistic opportunity for offshore wind to participate significantly will be in RESS 3.</p>
<p>Other levers mentioned are&nbsp;technology neutral but with enhanced LCOE. This would prioritise renewable projects, such as biomass and possibly solar/battery storage projects, which are able to dispatch on-demand to the grid. Details of the rules for such a level should be developed more fully to help understand the specifics of how it would operate and the opportunities for these specific technologies. However, it is likely that this will only impact a small share of renewable projects.</p>
<p>Importantly, the design paper discusses the possibility of&nbsp;variation in length of support per technology. Any such move would impact the economics of projects submitting bids and would have to be considered carefully in the auction process. Developers and lenders would want to know of the possibility of any such variation well in advance of any tender process to account for its impact.</p>
<h3>Community aspect</h3>
<p>An important consideration for the government when designing the RESS was the inclusion of communities in the design. Key points of note for renewable developers is a mandated community benefit fund of €2/MWhr for all RESS supported projects. Projects are also mandated to provide opportunities for communities within 10km to invest in all RESS projects with a preference given to those within 5km. There will be no minimum level of community investment required, and no penalties for projects that fail to attract community investment, provided the offerings have been made in a fair and transparent manner.</p>
<p>There is a commitment towards ensuring that no project is penalized due to the level of investment that is taken up, but the details of how this is implemented will have to be worked out. Since similar schemes operate in countries, such as Denmark and France, this shouldn’t be a hugely administrative burden. Nonetheless, details of the scheme would need to be confirmed soon to allow projects to engage meaningfully with communities about such investment opportunities prior to RESS 1 without it feeling like a tick box exercise.</p>
<h3>Grid connection</h3>
<p>The high-level design paper proposes that all projects bidding into RESS have a grid connection offer. However, an alternative approach proposes that projects approved in the auction have their grid application processed. Whether this would work in reality is currently difficult to envisage, as developers would have to know their actual connection cost before entering the auction in order to submit an accurate bid.</p>
<p>The confirmation of RESS’s high-level design along with a target of 55% RES-E (11TWhrs) and proposed roadmap out to 2030, lends confidence to the whole renewable energy industry in Ireland. Project developers can now identify the scale of Ireland’s ambition and plan their projects out to 2030 relative to a scheduled set of auctions and capacities.</p>
<p>One potential stumbling block is the significant amount of work required by the department, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) and Eirgrid, to facilitate the implementation of RESS and whether all three organisations have sufficient resources to accomplish the detailed design before the scheduled RESS 1 auction date in 2019.</p>
<p>There are numerous wind projects which did not obtain REFIT deadline who would be eager to participate in RESS. If however the RESS 1 auction is delayed, they may struggle to achieve the 2020 deadline or obtain support from lenders comfortable with the deadline. Beyond 2020, onshore wind should be the clear winner in the near to mid-term limited by any single technology cap imposed and any limitations imposed by the expected new Wind Energy Planning Guidelines.</p>
<p>The solar industry is the clear winner with regards to any delay encountered with RESS 1, whilst the 2020 delivery date is maintained due to its speed of deployment. There is approximately 350MW of solar projects with grid capacity to date which could participate in RESS 1. Solar participants in the ECP-1 process will also be keen to learn of their success in obtaining grid capacity. Solar projects are likely to benefit from any single technology cap used in RESS 2 due to the relative immaturity of the offshore sector.</p>
<p>Some of the current offshore wind projects are likely to target the RESS 2 auction, although a significant amount of work is needed from both a regulatory and consenting perspective to allow offshore projects to fully develop and this is likely to push their participation in RESS to RESS 3.</p>

<h3>3 - Digital transformation of energy utilities - Shifting gears?</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>By Rod Janssen</p>
<p>Since 2014, utilities have been increasing their investment in digital infrastructure. This is the key finding of the IEA report “energy and digitalization” which was published in November 2017. This report provides a detailed overview on how digitalization changes energy consumption in transportation, the industry and the residential sector. To us, the most interesting part of the report is the one focusing on the utilities’ investment in digital infrastructure.</p>

1183,"Depleting stupidity",NULL,NULL,"<p>First published <a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.onlyelevenpercent.com/depleting-stupidity/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a>.</p>
<p>I was glad to see that Amory Lovins returned to the subject of the size of the energy efficiency resource in a recent paper in&nbsp;<a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aad965"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Environmental Research Letters</a>.&nbsp;Amory mentions the oil and gas resource and reserve analogy that I wrote about again in May. <strong>The energy efficiency resource, just like other resources, is really found in the minds of people and the scale of the energy efficiency resource, just like oil and gas, is defined by our ways of thinking about them.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Amory says in one of his brilliant phrases; <em>“energy efficiency resources are infinitely expandable assemblages of ideas that deplete nothing but stupidity – a very abundant if not expanding resource”</em>.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>My PhD back in the early 1980s, “The Potential for Energy Conserving Capital Equipment in UK Industry”, examined the viability of Gerald Leach’s 1979&nbsp;<a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Low-Energy-Strategy-United-Kingdom/dp/0905927206"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Low Energy Strategy for the UK</a>&nbsp;and came to the conclusion that such a future was possible (in industry) even though it involved an improvement in energy efficiency of c.30%. As I have written about before (<a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://eeip.webseiten.cc/ https://www.onlyelevenpercent.com/surprise-you-are-living-in-a-low-energy-future-almost/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a>), we have practically achieved that future – a future that back then was regarded as impossible by the energy industry, the government and most analysts at the time.</p>
<p><strong>My view is that the potential using proven technology, current economics and “standard thinking” about energy efficiency is always about 30%. Thinking about energy efficiency in a different way using the integrative design techniques long pushed by Amory and others, but still not widely adopted, increases the size of the economic potential to much higher levels, maybe 60-70%.</strong></p>
<p>As is often the way several ideas or conversations come together at once.&nbsp; I am currently reading “<a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Zeronauts-Breaking-Sustainability-Barrier/dp/1849713979"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Zeronauts</a>”&nbsp;by environmental business guru John Elkington. It highlights the power of the idea of aiming for zero – zero energy, zero emissions, and zero environmental impact and highlights leaders who have worked to turn this idea into reality. Totally zero may not be possible in a particular situation but it is a powerful organising idea that opens up what may be possible. If leaders and decision makers don’t set a target and simply accept for instance a building built to building regulations, the potential efficiency resource remains unidentified and unexploited. Setting a target of zero energy may not actually result in zero but it certainly expands the way the design team and others think.</p>
<p>At the AECB’s recent conference, which was held in a community centre built to Passive House standards, I visited some Passive Houses and the Passive House technology is another example of how the mind defines the resource. Passive House is a technology, a combination of thinking and physical technologies, that enables the construction of a house that uses much less energy than a house built to building regulations, as well as delivering better comfort. <strong>If all new housing was built to Passive House standards the energy saving compared to houses built to code would be immense but most developers don’t even consider it, either because they don’t know about it or they believe it will cost more, or they don’t trust it</strong>. It takes leadership, stepping out of the norm, to specify a Passive House design as well as persistence often in the face of opposition.</p>
<p><strong>Many large new developments are now being built with district heating to meet planning regulations</strong>. It would be much more cost-effective to simply build the development to Passive House standards, thus eliminating the need for district heating with all of its central plant pipes, heat exchangers and control systems, all of which have on-going maintenance requirements. But again, unless leaders and decision makers consider the possibility, as well as the benefits, that potential energy efficiency resource will not be exploited, locking in unnecessary energy use and complexity for many years or even decades.</p>
<p>To make another connection, this week I participated in the first Advisory Council meeting of the Horizon 2020 funded project,<a data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.mbenefits.eu"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""> M-Benefits</a>. This important project is developing tools to help decision makers incorporate multiple non-energy benefits into decision making about energy efficiency projects. <strong>As I have said before, these non-energy benefits such as health, well-being, productivity, better learning outcomes etc., are far more strategic and therefore far more interesting to decision makers than simple energy cost savings.</strong> We need to focus selling efforts for low energy solutions on those benefits and regard energy (&amp; consequent energy cost savings) almost as a bonus. Doing so will lead to better business cases, higher rates of approval for projects and higher investment into energy efficient solutions.</p>
<p>So for any situation, industry, commerce, domestic, or transport, we can continue to think about the energy efficiency resource in the old way – and we will achieve significant economic and environmental gains, or we can change the way we think about it, aim for zero, insist on integrative design and value non-energy benefits and we will achieve far more, far more than the mainstream views on what is possible.</p>

1184,"Houston, we have a problem...",NULL,NULL,"
<p><em>This photograph of the Mission Operations Control Room in the Mission Control Center at the&nbsp;Manned Spacecraft Center (now Johnson Space Center), Houston, was taken on April 13, 1970, during the fourth television transmission from the Apollo 13 mission. Eugene F. Kranz (foreground, back to camera)</em></p>
<p>When I read the recent IPCC special report, I had that sinking feeling that people felt when Apollo 13 ran into serious problems in 1970 during its moon mission. Actually, the real quote by Commander James Lovell had the verb in the past tense. For us, in our current climate situation, the verb is definitely in the present. It is urgent and we need urgent action.</p>
<p>Throughout and immediately after the oil crises of the 1970s, energy efficiency was seen as a long-term solution. You can’t “do” energy efficiency with the snap of the fingers. It takes careful planning and comprehensive implementation. We have had over 40 years of experiments, pilot projects, research and other programmes. We know what to do.&nbsp; We have a lot of experience.&nbsp; Yes, we are developing new technologies and techniques. And we are figuring out new ways to finance and motivate. What we do not want is unsustainable energy demand reduction that is just a reaction to a crisis.&nbsp; At this point, there is no climate crisis even though there are worrying times. This is, however, the perfect time for a significant commitment to significantly improved energy efficiency throughout our economies.</p>
<p>What we are really missing today is that real sense of urgency, that commitment to ambitious energy efficiency improvements that lead to significant energy savings and carbon reductions. Maybe people really do not believe that improved energy efficiency can have that much impact. Understandably, improved energy efficiency is only part of the solution. It is not the silver bullet to solve all our concerns. There is no silver bullet. Period.</p>
<p>We know we are in the midst of the low-carbon energy transition. We know we must decarbonise in all sectors.&nbsp; We know that our link with fossil fuels must be broken. We also know, more than ever, that we can. A decade ago we never thought we could improve the energy performance of our buildings by a factor of four. Now, with new techniques and technologies, we know we can. There are similar possibilities in all end-use sectors.</p>
<ul> 	<li>At the recent&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2018/october/iea-holds-the-third--annual-global-conference-on-energy-efficiency-.html"" target=""_blank"">IEA global conference on energy efficiency</a>, there were some very good presentations of initiatives underway. Not only I felt there was no sense of urgency that we had to take our lessons learned and substantially scale up our actions. <strong>Importantly, there was evidence showing that improvements in energy efficiency have actually stalled in many parts of the world</strong>. And this came up about Europe as well, so there is no bragging about how good we are.</li> 	<li>At the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/news/events/behave/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">5th European Conference on Behaviour and Energy Efficiency</a>, held in Zurich in September, there was evidence of good research underway but a similar lack of urgency. <strong>Most of the research presented were going to lead to small changes in behaviour and not obviously addressing how this could be achieved at a national or regional scale.</strong> And again, it was not only my feelings.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>But it is the recent IPCC special <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">report </a>that should be the game changer.</strong> Hopefully the European Union and all its institutions will rise to the occasion and show the leadership we need. There are other countries that have backed away (hopefully, only temporarily). The European Union needs to accept the challenge and set new policies that will convince others to act accordingly.</p>
<p>So, we all have a role to play. It is not just governments that we must look up to. This is a challenge that every one of us must rise to meet.</p>
<p>It won’t be soon, but hopefully we will be able to change the verb from have to had. No one said the low-carbon energy transition would be easy. The energy efficiency community has much to do to convince the wider public why “energy efficiency first” has to be taken much, much more seriously.</p>
<p>Houston, the time is now to solve this problem . . .</p>

<p>Earlier this year, we looked at how&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://blogs.dnvgl.com/energy/top-5-ways-zne-can-make-life-more-comfortable-during-global-weirding"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">zero net energy can make life more comfortable as the weather gets weirder</a>, and how utilities can strategically use ZNE to address the changing grid. In this blog, I’ll highlight some of the latest research from my colleague Jennifer McWilliams on the potential for utility-sponsored ZNE-ready manufactured housing. If you’re attending this year’s ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings, stop by the&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://iframes.aceee.org/confpanel.cfm?&amp;ConferencePanelID=299"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Net Zero panel</a>&nbsp;to hear the full presentation on ‘Manufactured Housing: It is Easy and Enticing, is it Energy Efficient?’ or download the whitepaper afterward.</p>
<h3>Prefab as a solution for places with bad weather</h3>
<p><a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.constructiondive.com/news/8-construction-trends-to-watch-in-2018/514284/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">Offsite, or prefab, construction continues to be a key trend for the construction industry</a>, allowing for faster construction timelines that aren’t as dependent on weather as traditional construction projects. This provides an opportunity for quick and inexpensive housing for an increasing number of people displaced by weather events, such as wildfires, hurricanes and floods.</p>
<p>Some of the highest incidents of natural disasters in the US have been in California, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. These states also have the highest volume of manufactured (including modular and mobile) homes purchases. It would make sense for these homes to provide comfort and be resilient during future weather events. Even if the homes were initially purchased as temporary disaster relief housing, they are often resold and have a second life as permanent housing.</p>
<h3>Current hurdle for mass-producing energy efficiency and resiliency</h3>
<p>ENERGY STAR®&nbsp;currently offers an&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.energystar.gov/newhomes/homes_prog_reqs/national_page"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">ENERGY STAR Certified Homes Program</a>that includes modular and manufactured homes. The Department of Energy built upon ENERGY STAR®&nbsp;Homes v3 and is offering a&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/zero-energy-ready-home"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">Zero Energy Ready Home program</a>. &nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/doe-tour-zero-first-doe-zero-energy-ready-manufactured-home-southern-energy-homes"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">DOE has also partnered with builders</a>&nbsp;to develop Zero Energy Ready manufactured mobile homes.</p>
<p>Although many factories are certified to produce ENERGY STAR®&nbsp;homes, and some have also started producing&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://zeroenergyproject.org/2016/09/20/prefab-zero-energy-homes-lower-cost-efficient-wider-availability/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">prefab zero energy homes</a>, the consumer demand for these homes is still low due to the increased capital required. This drives a Catch 22 situation — due to the low production volume for more efficient and resilient homes (which follow a different production line process than standard homes), these homes are more costly for the manufacturer, making them more costly for the consumer.</p>
<h3>Opportunity for utilities, manufactured home factories, and communities</h3>
<p>This provides an opportunity for the utility to step in by providing an upstream new construction program for the manufactured homes factories. Incentives could be offered to move the production line entirely to ENERGY STAR®-levels (or ZNE-ready, in places like California where it will soon be code for permanent homes, including modular). The benefit of a single production line is reduced cost for both the manufacturer and consumer.</p>
<p>This allows the utility to achieve new construction savings at a low incremental cost, target and transform an underserved market, and support communities with resiliency and carbon reduction goals. To help facilitate this and optimize the incentives, utilities and municipalities across the manufactured homes factory territories are encouraged to develop a combined offering.</p>
<p>In just two more years, ZNE will become the&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/ZNE/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">residential code</a>&nbsp;for California, with&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://database.aceee.org/state/buildings-summary"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">several other states</a>&nbsp;and regions also on the path to setting more aggressive building codes. Resiliency is also taking ‘<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.constructiondive.com/news/8-construction-trends-to-watch-in-2018/514284/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">center stage</a>’ in the construction industry, and more utilities and communities are placing their focus on how to survive the next big storm. ZNE-ready manufactured housing can provide a more durable and resilient housing solution, and allow utilities and builders to partner and create more resilient grids and communities.</p>

1187,"Climate change might double the cost of a beer",NULL,NULL,"<p><em>This article has been republished&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://energytransition.org/2018/11/climate-change-might-double-the-cost-of-a-beer/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/climate-change-might-double-the-cost-of-a-beer/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">WIRED</a>.</em></p>
<p>Despite adapted cultivation techniques, it appears like problems in beer production cannot be avoided.&nbsp;<a href=""https://pixabay.com/de/weizen-gras-gerste-herbst-ernte-863392/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">(Public Domain)</a></p>
<p>Beer drinkers might pay more and find less of their favorite beverage as <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/guide-climate-change/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">climate change</a> comes for barley. Scientists expect that extreme droughts and heat waves will become more frequent and intense in the regions that grow the grain. <a href=""http://www.ericniiler.com/about/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Eric Niiler</a> takes a look at the facts:</p>
<p>Many farmers are already adapting to the slowly warming planet—with <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2017/04/want-better-beer-good-heres-better-barley-genome/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">advanced plant breeding</a> techniques to create more drought-resistant grains, for example, and by using more efficient <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2017/05/robots-agriculture/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">irrigation systems</a> to conserve water—but a new <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-018-0263-1"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">study</a> out today in the journal Nature Plants says that many regions won’t be able to cope with the arid conditions of the future. The work was done by a group of researchers in China along with Steven J. Davis, an environmental scientist at the University of California Irvine.</p>
<p><strong>The team looked at the areas around the world that grow barley, which is turned into malt for beer, and projected what will occur under five different climate warming scenarios by 2100</strong>. Using models of both economic activity and climate change, the group made predictions about what will happen to barley production, as well as beer price and consumption.</p>
<p><strong>During the most <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/an-equator-full-of-hurricanes-shows-a-preview-of-end-times/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">severe climate events</a>, the study predicts that global beer consumption would decline by 16 percent, an amount about equal to the total annual beer consumption of the United States in 2011</strong>. It also expects average beer prices to double. Each country would be affected differently. The price of a single pint of beer in Ireland, for example, will rise by $4.84, followed by $4.52 in Italy and $4.34 in Canada. American tipplers will see beer prices rise up to $1.94 under the extreme events, the study said, and barley farmers will export more to other nations.</p>
<p>Davis, who has published several papers on climate change and the <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/why-trump-wants-to-save-jobs-in-china/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chinese economy</a>, says many extreme drought and heat events will force farmers to feed barley to livestock instead of selling it to domestic breweries.</p>
<blockquote><p>“When we have these shortages, our models suggest people are going to feed the barley to the livestock before they make beer,” Davis said. “That makes sense. This is a luxury commodity and it’s more important to have food on the table.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The effects of climate change are already being felt by craft brewers, says Katie Wallace, director of social and environmental responsibility at New Belgium Brewery in Fort Collins, Colorado.</strong> In 2014, the US barley-growing region—Montana, North Dakota and Idaho—was hit by an extremely wet and warm winter that caused crops to sprout early, rendering much of it useless. Farmers were forced to tap into reserves in storage. In 2017 and again this past summer, the Pacific Northwest was hit by severe drought that affected production of hops that give unique flavors to craft brews. Wallace says that climate change is on the minds of all craft brewers as they plan for how to avoid future shortages of both barley and hops.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Its stressful,” Newman said. “We are seeing an increased level of vulnerability and some near escapes in some cases. All of these things have happened periodically, but the frequency is growing.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The craft beer industry is already planning for the future, says Chris Swersey, a supply chain specialist at the Brewer’s Association, a trade group that represents 4,500 small breweries across the country. Swersey says he is skeptical of the paper’s findings, mainly because it assumes that the amount and location of barley production will stay the same as it is today. He says barley growing is already moving north to Canada, while researchers are hoping to expand barley’s range with winter-hardy breeds.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The industry is already aware that barley production is shifting,” Swersey says. “We need to be thinking ahead and be smart about what is our climate going to look like 50 or 100 years from now.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not just the little guys who are thinking of climate change. The king of US beer production remains Budweiser, which produces the number 1 (Bud Light) and number 3 (Budweiser) <a href=""https://247wallst.com/special-report/2018/06/27/top-selling-beers-in-america/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">top-selling brands</a>. Budweiser buys barley from a vast network of farmers in the northern US and is investing in new breeds of drought-resistant barley strains, according to Jessica Newman, director of agronomy for Budweiser.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s all about getting the right varieties, getting the right mix, and getting the right technology to our growers,” Newman says from her office in Idaho Falls, Idaho.</p></blockquote>
<p>She says Budweiser’s crop science lab in Colorado is working on new barley strains dubbed Voyager, Merit 57 and Growler.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are breeding for drought resistance and sprout resistance,” Newman said. “If we see rainfall coming earlier, or if it rains in the wrong time of year, the barley can sprout and it wouldn’t be used. We also want it to use less water and fewer agricultural chemicals.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Climate scientist Davis says he and his colleagues wrote the study as a thought exercise to perhaps stoke conversation about how climate change affects our daily lives.</p>
<blockquote><p>“A paper on beer might seem a little bit frivolous when it’s dealing with a topic that poses existential threats,” Davis said. “But some of us have a personal love of beer and thought this might be interesting.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Climate change won’t just alter the weather; it’ll also hit our grocery tabs and hobbies.</p>

<p>Green Bonds have been around for a decade. The World Bank first issued them in 2008 for an equivalent amount of USD 10 million, but starting to take off in 2013 and growing since. In 2017 an equivalent amount of USD 157 billion were issued worldwide.</p>

<p>Hera was the first Italian utility to launch a Green Bond to finance or refinance sustainable projects, in line with its commitment to sustainable development. In July 2014 the company offered a&nbsp;ten-year bond for an equivalent amount of EUR 500 million, envisaging a coupon of 2.375% and a return of 2.436%.&nbsp;The offer received great attention in Europe, especially from investors in France, Germany and Great Britain in 2014, and outside Europe in 2015. The following figure shows the Green Bond’s filing date by country and by year (2014 and 2015).</p>

<h3>Sustainable Projects&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The list of projects eligible for funding were established on the basis of specific environmental criteria, and successively confirmed by a global quality assurance and risk management company to ensure the appropriate allocation of the funds. Every year, the external and independent company certifies that Hera is proceeding with the promised green investments.</p>
<p>A total of 26 projects were financed or refinanced from 2006 to 2016 for a total investment of €732M and covering the amount of the Green Bond of €500M. Ten projects in renewable energy for a total of €57,4M,&nbsp;seven projects in energy efficiency for a total of&nbsp;€223,4M, four waste to energy plants projects for a total of €173,2M, four wastewater treatment plants projects for a total of €34M, and one separate waste collection project for a total of €13,7M.</p>

<p>To better understand, I divided the environmental category into project category and specific projects. Waste-to-energy plants, district heating networks projects, and cogeneration plants projects received the most of the funds. The following figure illustrates the breakdown of the projects, by environmental category, project category, specific projects, and related investments in €M.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Considerations</h3>
<p>Based on the analyzed data from the Hera Group, the following points are made:</p>
<ul> 	<li>Energy efficiency plays a significant role in the total investments for sustainable projects financed with the Green Bonds. Other projects category include waste-to-energy, renewable energy, wastewater treatment, and separate waste collection.</li> 	<li>All the projects produced tangible results, and were measured with KPIs, to include Primary Energy Savings, Avoided CO2&nbsp;Emissions, Net Electricity Produced, and Thermal Energy Produced. Because KPIs are project-specific, only partial aggregation was possible from the project category (energy efficiency and renewable energy).</li> 	<li>The Hera Group is a great example of a company that is investing in sustainable energy projects and achieving results by combining all the different available instruments, from Green Bonds to White Certificates (see my previous article).</li> 	<li>Green Bonds are part of the several instruments available to companies to invest in sustainable projects. There is no good or bad, better or worse. Companies should evaluate which instrument is better for them, based on the technology, market, and regulation.</li> </ul>

<p>Is ICP the Alexander the Great of century XXI? And what has this to do with the Gordian Knot? They key point is that bold action was needed to cut the Gordian knot - and that is what ICP can deliver to tackle one of the most complex challenges in the energy efficiency sector - how to make energy efficiency projects bankable to increase the investment flow into this sector enabling re-financing of ESCOs and project developers and to increase trust on the client side.</p>

<h3>2 - Next steps in financing energy efficiency improvements in Europe's industry&nbsp; and energy supply</h3>


<p>By Rod Janssen</p>

<p>How to get financing for district energy and industrial energy efficiency projects? How to get financing transaction costs down and create trust amongst investors? Answer: by using a standard process protocol developed jointly by industry experts and investors. On September 11th, the Investor Confidence Project Europe (ICPeurope) will be holding training for project developers involved in industry and energy supply. This will allow you not only to get access to the investor network but also crack a typical dilemma: Energy supply market requires long-term financial commitment which contrasts with the focus on short-term returns on investment.</p>

<h3>3 - You've got a friend</h3>

<p>By Rod Janssen</p>

<p>There are 22 million SMEs in the EU. Most of them have to fight in the marketplace and seldomly the capacity to systematically exploit energy savings. Often not only the basic measures are implemented. A key reason is they have to manage the triangle between themself, the project developer and financing. So they need a friend. In other words help. And here is where ICP can help.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>If the cement industry were a country, it would be the third largest emitter in the world.</strong></p>
<p>In 2015, it generated&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/news_docs/jrc-2016-trends-in-global-co2-emissions-2016-report-103425.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">around 2.8bn tonnes</a>&nbsp;of CO2, equivalent to 8% of the global total –&nbsp;a greater share than any country other than China or the US.</p>
<p>Cement use is set to rise as global urbanisation and economic development increases demand for new buildings and infrastructure. Along with other parts of the global economy, the cement industry will need to dramatically cut its emissions to meet the Paris Agreement’s temperature&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-the-final-paris-climate-deal"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">goals</a>.

<h3>What is cement?</h3>
<p>Cement is used in construction to bind other materials together. It is mixed with sand, gravel and water to produce&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.hanson.co.uk/en/technical-information/what-is-concrete"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">concrete</a>, the most widely used construction material in the world. Over 10bn tonnes of concrete are&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/making-concrete-change-innovation-low-carbon-cement-and-concrete"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">used each year</a>.</p>
<p>The industry standard is a type called&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.britannica.com/technology/portland-cement"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Portland cement</a>. This was&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.understanding-cement.com/history.html#"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">invented</a>&nbsp;in the early 1800s and named after a building stone widely used in England at the time. It is&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/making-concrete-change-innovation-low-carbon-cement-and-concrete"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">used in 98%</a>&nbsp;of concrete globally today, with 4bn tonnes produced each year.</p>
<p>The production of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.understanding-cement.com/clinker.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Portland clinker</a>, which acts as the binder, is a crucial step in making Portland cement. Limestone (CaCO3) is “calcinated” at high temperatures in a cement kiln to produce lime (CaO), leading to the release of waste CO2. Overall, the following reaction occurs:</p>
<p>&lt;iframe src=""https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2html-cb/cement-equation/equation.html"" name=""equation"" width=""450px"" height=""80px"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>
<h3>Why does cement emit so much CO2?</h3>
<p><a href=""http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/news_docs/jrc-2016-trends-in-global-co2-emissions-2016-report-103425.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Around half</a>&nbsp;of the emissions from cement are process emissions arising from the reaction above. This is a principle reason cement emissions are often considered difficult to cut: since this CO2 is released by a chemical reaction, it can not be eliminated by changing fuel or increasing efficiency.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/making-concrete-change-innovation-low-carbon-cement-and-concrete"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">further 40%</a>&nbsp;of cement emissions come from burning fossil fuels to heat kilns to the high temperatures needed for this calcination process. The last 10% of emissions come from fuels needed to mine and transport the raw materials.</p>
<p>Therefore, cement emissions depend largely on the proportion of clinker used in each tonne of cement. The type of fuel and efficiency of equipment used during clinker production also have an impact.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the floor area of the world’s buildings is&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.worldgbc.org/sites/default/files/UNEP%20188_GABC_en%20%28web%29.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">projected to double</a>&nbsp;in the next 40 years. This means cement production is set to grow to&nbsp;<a href=""http://awsassets.panda.org/downloads/englishsummary__lr_pdf.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">around 5bn tonnes</a>&nbsp;by 2030, a 25% increase from today, reaching over four times&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/373845/global-cement-production-forecast/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">1990 levels</a>.</p>
<p>Efficiency gains alone will, therefore, not be enough to significantly cut the sector’s emissions.</p>
<h3>Which countries have high cement emissions?</h3>

<p>China is by far the largest producer of cement, followed far behind by India and the combined countries of the EU, as the graph below from a recent&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/making-concrete-change-innovation-low-carbon-cement-and-concrete"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">report</a>&nbsp;by Chatham House shows. Three-quarters of cement production since 1990&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.earth-syst-sci-data.net/10/195/2018/essd-10-195-2018.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">occurred</a>&nbsp;in China, which&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Concrete-in-China"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">used</a>&nbsp;more cement between 2011 and 2013 than the US did in the entire 20th century.</p>

<p>In Europe, existing kiln facilities are capable of meeting future demand for cement, according to Chatham House. European cement producers are also some of the most advanced in terms of their use of alternative fuels, it adds. However,&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://carbon-pulse.com/29833/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">older equipment</a>puts them behind India and China on energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Likewise, the US, the fourth-largest cement consumer, lags behind other major producers in terms of energy efficiency and its clinker ratio.</p>

<h3>Have cement emissions been reduced?</h3>
<p>The average CO2 intensity of cement production – the emissions per tonne of output –&nbsp;has fallen by 18% globally over the past few decades, according to Chatham House. However, the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.earth-syst-sci-data.net/10/195/2018/essd-10-195-2018.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">sector’s emissions</a>&nbsp;as a whole have risen significantly, with demand tripling since 1990.</p>
<p>Progress so far has come in three main areas:</p>
<ul> 	<li>First, more efficient cement kilns have made production less energy-intensive. This can improve further: global average energy use per tonne of cement is&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.iea.org/etp/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">still around</a>&nbsp;20% higher than production with current best available technology and practice.</li> 	<li>Second, use of alternative fuels has also lowered emissions – for example, using biomass or waste in place of coal. This is especially the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263714046_Use_of_alternative_fuels_in_cement_industry"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">case in Europe</a>, where around 43% of fuel consumption now comes from alternatives, Chatham House says.</li> 	<li>Third, reducing the proportion of Portland clinker in cement has also cut emissions. &nbsp;“High-blend” cements can reduce emissions per kilogram by up to four times, according to Chatham House. Clinker can be substituted with other cement-like materials, including waste from coal combustion and steelmaking. This can affect the cement’s properties, however, so is only suitable for some end uses.</li> </ul>

<p>The world average clinker ratio (clinker:cement) fell to&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/TechnologyRoadmapLowCarbonTransitionintheCementIndustry.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">0.65 in 2014</a>, with a large range from 0.57 in China to 0.87 in Eurasia.</p>
<p>After several decades of progress, the CO2 intensity of cement changed little from 2014 to 2016,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.iea.org/tcep/industry/cement/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">according</a>&nbsp;to the International Energy Agency (<a href=""https://www.iea.org/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">IEA</a>). This is because energy efficiency improvements were offset by a slight increase in the clinker ratio, it says.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, overall cement emissions were flat or declining in recent years as demand in China levelled off.</p>

<h3>How far can cement emissions be cut?</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.iea.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">IEA</a>&nbsp;and the industry-led Cement Sustainability Initiative (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.wbcsdcement.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">CSI</a>) recently released a new&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/TechnologyRoadmapLowCarbonTransitionintheCementIndustry.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">low-carbon roadmap</a>, showing how it considers emissions can be cut in line with a “2C” scenario and a “below 2C” scenario. The roadmap assumes cement demand will increase 12-23% by 2050.</p>
<p>For a 2C scenario – in line with 50% chance of limiting global temperature rise to 2C above pre-industrial levels by 2100 – the roadmap says a 24% cut in cement emissions is needed. (It is worth noting this is not in line with the&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/category/policy/paris-2015"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">Paris Agreement</a>, which calls for temperature rise to stay “well below” 2C at the very least.)</p>
<p>The roadmap relies on four areas of action for these emissions cuts.</p>
<p>Three of these are the strategies previously being pursued by the cement industry to limit emissions, namely, improved energy efficiency, lower-emission fuels and lower clinker ratios.</p>
<p>For example, the roadmap sets a target average global clinker ratio of 0.60 by 2050, down from 0.65. This is a significant challenge: Chatham House notes it would need around 40% more clinker substitutes by 2050 than today, at a time when the availability of traditional substitutes – fly ash and blast-furnace slag – will likely begin to fall.</p>
<p>The fourth area is “innovative technologies”, which is essentially shorthand for reducing emissions using carbon capture and storage (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/absence-carbon-capture-storage-biggest-challenge-2c-limit"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">CCS</a>). This has not yet been used in the cement industry (bar&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.norcem.no/en/carbon_capture"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">trials</a>), but the roadmap assumes integration of CCS in the cement sector reaches commercial-scale deployment by 2030.&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583614001170"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">Uncertainty</a>&nbsp;over the potential to rapidly scale-up CCS and its&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.bgs.ac.uk/discoveringGeology/climateChange/CCS/TheCostofCSS.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">large cost</a>&nbsp;are major barriers to its use in reducing concrete emissions.</p>
<p>The chart below shows Chatham House analysis of the IEA and CSI cement roadmap. The red dotted line shows the 24% emissions cut in line with the 2C scenario (2DS) by 2050.</p>
<p><em>Ways of reducing cement emissions leading to a “Paris-compatible” pathway. Three scenarios are shown: “reference technology scenario” (RTS), “2C scenario” &nbsp;(2DS) and “beyond 2C scenario” (B2DS).

<p>The roadmap also sets out a “beyond 2C” scenario (B2DS; purple dotted line above), whereby a far higher 60% reduction in emissions would be required. Here, the proportion of total cement CO2 emissions captured by CCS would need to more than double compared to the 2C scenario, up to 63% in 2050, the roadmap says. It notes this “will be challenging to achieve”.</p>
<p>Chatham House also notes that steeper reductions will be needed “if assumptions about the contribution from CCS technologies prove to be optimistic”. It says:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Shifting beyond 2DS will require transformative action on clinker substitution, novel cements and CCS as well as deploying an array of demand-side approaches beyond the sector to lower overall consumption. These also become more critical if CCS proves too challenging to scale.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>Can ‘novel’ cements cut emissions?</h3>

<p>Some companies have been researching “novel” cements, which do away with the need for Portland clinker altogether. If these could rival the cost and performance of Portland cement, they would offer a way to significantly reduce emissions.</p>
<p>However, none have yet achieved large-scale commercial use and are currently used only in niche applications. Moreover, innovation in the sector tends to focus on incremental changes, a global patent search by Chatham House shows, with a limited focus on novel cements.</p>
<p>Geopolymer-based cements, for example, have been a focus of research since the 1970s. These do not use calcium carbonate as a key ingredient, harden at room temperature and release only water.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.zeobond.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Zeobond</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.banahuk.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">banahUK</a>&nbsp;are among firms producing these, with both claiming around 80-90% reduction in emissions compared to Portland cement.</p>
<p>There are also several firms developing “<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958946516301275"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">carbon-cured</a>” cements, which absorb CO2, rather than water, as they harden. If this CO2 absorption can be made higher than CO2 released during their production, cements could&nbsp;<a href=""https://qz.com/1123875/the-material-that-built-the-modern-world-is-also-destroying-it-heres-a-fix/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">potentially</a>&nbsp;be used as a carbon sink.</p>

<p>US firm&nbsp;<a href=""http://solidiatech.com/"">Solidia</a>, for example, claims its concrete emits up to 70% less CO2 than Portland cement, including this sequestering step. The firm is now in a partnership with major cement producer&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.lafargeholcim.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">LafargeHolcim</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, British start-up&nbsp;<a href=""http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/pls/portallive/docs/1/50161701.PDF"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Novacem</a>&nbsp;– a spin out from Imperial College London –&nbsp;<a href=""http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/pls/portallive/docs/1/50161701.PDF"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">claimed</a>&nbsp;in 2008 that replacing Portland cement with its “<a href=""https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/construction/materials/carbon-negative-cement.htm"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">carbon negative</a>” product would allow the industry to become a net sink of CO2 emissions. However, the firm failed to raise sufficient funds to continue research and production.</p>
<p>Other firms are using completely different materials to make cement. North Carolina-based startup&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://biomason.com/about-us/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">Biomason</a>, for example, uses bacteria to grow cement bricks which it&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://biomason.com/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">says</a>&nbsp;are both similarly strong to traditional masonry and carbon-sequestering.</p>

<p>The table below, from Chatham House, summarises the stages of development of several alternative cement technologies.</p>

<h3>What are the barriers to low-carbon cement?</h3>
<p>There are several reasons low-clinker or novel cements have so far failed to reach widespread use.</p>
<p>These technologies are less tried-and-tested than Portland cement, which has been used in construction for centuries. This leads to resistance from cement consumers, particularly in a sector which – for obvious reasons – tends to put safety as a high priority. Many of these new technologies are also not mature enough to reach wide-scale use.</p>
<p>Alternatives also tend to have more limited applications, meaning there may be no single replacement for Portland cement. Their use would, therefore, mean a move away from prescriptive standards. Currently, almost all standards, design codes and protocols for testing cement binders and concrete are based on the use of Portland cement, notes Chatham House. It adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>“New approaches and especially new industry standards require a lot of discussion and testing. For example, it can take decades for a new standard to be approved and implemented in the EU.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, recent advances in materials testing of concrete could allow its chemistry to be better understood, giving more confidence for industry standards to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Alternative cements also need to be able to compete with Portland cement on cost, particularly in the absence of strong regulatory or policy pressure such as carbon prices. But switching could require investments in new equipment or more expensive materials, which could take several years to recoup, says Chatham House.</p>
<p>Access to enough of the raw materials needed for some cements is also a major consideration. For example, the local availability of&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.concreteconstruction.net/how-to/materials/what-is-fly-ash_o"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">fly ash</a>&nbsp;– a by-product of coal combustion and one of the most-used clinker substitutes – is decreasing as coal-fired power plants are closed.</p>
<h4>Can cement demand be reduced?</h4>

<p>Reducing demand for cement could also help to limit emissions, particularly in&nbsp;<a href=""https://newclimateeconomy.report/2016/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">developing countries</a>. For example, Chatham House highlights how urban designs based on a “<a href=""http://conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2012/eproceedings/urbane/p25.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">capillary web</a>” system and walking rather than cars can use a third less concrete. Similarly, principles from Gothic cathedrals have been used to design modern concrete floors that are&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ppcimaginarium.co.za/posts/gothic-novelty"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">70% lighter</a>&nbsp;than conventional counterparts.</p>

<h3>Are cement emissions regulated?</h3>
<p>Cement is often&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/187071/decarbonising-emissions-difficult-impossible-says-review/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">considered</a>&nbsp;too difficult to decarbonise, along with other sectors such as&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/aviation-consume-quarter-carbon-budget"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">aviation</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.carboncommentary.com/blog/2018/8/14/how-much-of-the-uks-emissions-are-nearly-impossible-to-decarbonise"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">steel</a>. As one recent&nbsp;<a href=""http://media.bze.org.au/ZCIndustry/bze-report-rethinking-cement-web.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">report</a>&nbsp;noted, if cement emissions are mentioned at all in public debate, “it is typically to note that little can be done about them”.</p>
<p>As a result, the cement industry has faced less political and commercial pressure compared to the power sector,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/felix-preston"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Felix Preston</a>&nbsp;tells Carbon Brief. Preston is senior research fellow at&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.chathamhouse.org/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chatham House</a>&nbsp;and co-author of its cement report. He says the sector is still dominated by a handful of major firms that control large parts of the market. Preston adds:</p>
<p>“[These firms] are often dominant or very influential in a geographical area, as well as on the global stage. I think that has made it difficult – and it’s still difficult – to press for radical change. They don’t necessarily see the immediate incentive to take ambitious action.”</p>

1191,"Interview to Rod Janssen - ""We can't oversell energy efficiency""",NULL,NULL,"

<p><strong>Interview Energy Efficiency</strong></p>
<h1>ABOVE THE RADAR</h1>

<blockquote><p>“<strong>We can’t oversell Energy Efficiency”, says EEIP* President Rod Janssen. But with the Energy Management System ISO 50001, and the Energy Efficiency Directive in place, it is plain to see for everyone that Energy Efficiency has become an important economic and industrial factor far beyond climate protection. For Janssen, the best event to learn and discuss best practice, is the World Sustainable Energy Days in Wels, Austria.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Communication Works: Energy efficiency used to be the poor cousin of renewable energy. Unlike for renewables, targets for efficiency were not binding. Today, more policy-makers claim that energy efficiency must come first. What has changed?</p>
<p>Rod Janssen: Energy efficiency has come a long way since the debate started with the first oil crisis in the 1970s. We all remember some vehicle-free Sundays. But we also know how it went: People were afraid that saving energy could harm the economy. Energy use and economic growth were very intertwined.</p>
<p>That is also why energy efficiency used to be measured as energy intensity: energy use per unit of economic output. It is very hard to have a binding target for that.</p>
<h3>Energy Efficiency First</h3>
<h4>What does it look like today?</h4>
<p>Now it is commonly assumed that economic growth and energy use can be decoupled and we also know what Energy Efficiency can do for meeting our Paris climate obligations.</p>
<p>Therefore, the European Parliament has taken a much more ambitious approach to Energy Efficiency. The Commission has been a little slower. The Member States are the ones that actually have to implement the policies and are responsible for meeting targets. So, they tend to be more conservative. That’s probably why the Council has been much slower.</p>
<p>That said, they have met half way and agreed to give Energy Efficiency a much higher profile by agreeing to a 32,5% target with an upward revision clause. Also, the target is now on primary energy savings. That makes it easier to monitor developments.Even if the target is still not binding: We’re now finally talking about Energy Efficiency. First.</p>
<h4>So, what you’re saying is: Now it’s for real. It’s not just on paper.</h4>
<p>We have to be careful because we can’t oversell Energy Efficiency. But one IEA report from 2015 already showed that there are many non-energy benefits. For example, health benefits as the air quality improves. There are also competitiveness benefits that we better understand now.</p>
<h3>Industrial Competitiveness</h3>
<h4>There are large untapped potentials for improving Energy Efficiency, especially in energy-intensive industries. But sectors like the chemical industry, steel or the pulp and paper mills have been reluctant in the past to take action. What does it take to motivate them?</h4>
<p>There is a lot of potential. No doubt about it. And a lot has already happened in these energy-intensive industries under the radar. But the large energy intensive industries are very conscious of what’s going on in Asia or America. They’re not going to let their competitors get the upper hand over them.</p>
<p>In order to be more attractive, Energy Efficiency should be seen as a strategic equipment in itself to increase competitiveness. It must be discussed at the top management level and seriously treated as a strategic decision.</p>
<p>I also think that with increasing CO2 prices, the emission trading scheme will play a stronger role in enhancing efficiency in the future.</p>
<h4>What about small and medium-size enterprises?</h4>
<p>This is a problem. Europe has a lot of SMEs, the world has a lot of SMEs, but the awareness of the importance for improving energy efficiency is not there. Most national governments are much more focused on the large energy intensive industries.</p>
<p>Even if the top 30 companies may be responsible for 80% of industrial energy consumption, there is big potential for energy savings with SMEs. They also are a motor of job creation and general welfare in the regions, so it is important to support them.</p>
<h3>“SMEs need more than money. They need access”</h3>
<h4>What do you suggest should be done?</h4>
<p>The SMEs could need a sort of “One Stop Shop” where they can talk about both technical and financial issues. That role could be plaid for example by national or regional energy agencies like there is in Upper Austria.</p>
<p>Often SMEs don’t know how to build a business case for an investment in energy efficiency. They aren’t aware of the possibilities to turn to an Energy Service Company. Such an intermediary is often valuable for building a more convincing case for a bank.</p>
<p>Member States should establish long-term energy performance strategies for SMEs in regular intervals. Just like Member States are required by the Buildings Directive to develop long-term renovation strategies for buildings und update them every three years. That would force them to consult SMEs and Industry as a whole.</p>
<p>Only providing funding by the European Union and many Member States is not good enough. SMEs need support to access the money. Today, the amount of paperwork or the complexity of procedures is too much for them.</p>
<h3>The three biggest achievements in industrial Energy Efficiency</h3>
<h4>You said: “a lot has happened under the radar”. What are the three biggest achievements in industrial Energy Efficiency in the past 10 years?</h4>
<p>The most significant change in the last 10 years has been the introduction of Energy Management Systems, the ISO 50001. It changes the culture within a company towards energy efficiency, renewables and energy management as a whole.</p>
<p>In the past, most large companies would have an energy manager hidden somewhere on the factory floor. The ISO 50001 takes a more comprehensive approach from the company Board right down to the people working in the factory. In Germany and many other countries, it has taken off well and become very popular.</p>
<h4>Has European legislation had any influence?</h4>
<p>The second important development was the replacement of the Energy Saving Directive by the Energy Efficiency Directive by in 2012. This was the first time that the European Commission has introduced an energy efficiency instrument for the industrial sector with mandatory audits for large industrial companies.</p>
<p>Member States have now accomplished the first round of mandatory energy efficiency audits. And while the Directive made it only mandatory for large industries, some countries, like Italy, also included larger SMEs. Whether this first round was successful or not, is not so important. The big step was to get the industrial sector on a learning curve.</p>
<p>The Directive also provided some first guidance to SMEs and encouraged the recovery of waste heat from industrial processes.</p>
<h4>And the third achievement?</h4>
<p>The third important instrument was the emissions trading system as a driver for more energy efficiency. Although, to date, we have not seen sufficient results to promote energy efficiency.</p>
<h3>Global best practice in Wels</h3>
<h4>What’s left to be done?</h4>
<p>The latest IPCC special report makes clear that we mustn’t go beyond 1.5 degrees Centigrade, so we need to set our eyes on this goal.</p>
<p>Some people say that in many countries and sectors the low-hanging fruit now are gone. I completely disagree with that. Everybody has still more to do!</p>
<p>Let’s take the mandatory audits I mentioned before: 90% of the measures recommended by the energy audits have not been executed yet.</p>
<p>The beverage industry and Belgium is a good example. They are very progressive and always looking for the most innovative ways to brew beer. That is the culture we have to develop: We can’t rest on our laurels and be happy with 30-year-old boilers.</p>
<p>We should be looking at best practice globally. The World Sustainable Energy Days held every year in Wels, Austria, provide an excellent occasion to do that.</p>
<h4>What do events like the World Sustainable Energy Days contribute?</h4>

<p>These are early days for the industrial sector. It needs inspiration from other sectors. Therefore, the World Sustainable Energy Days are important to share ideas and learn from each other. It’s encouraging to see so many experts and get so much analysis from all parts of the World. People from the Commission are listening. You get information about the results from EU-funded projects.</p>
<p>What is particularly interesting for industry representatives is the tradeshow where you can actually see and touch the technologies and discuss with the suppliers. People in industry love that.</p>
<p>We work too much in silos. When we are talking about buildings we should also talk about renewables. When we talk about renewables we should also talk about energy efficiency because they must work closely together in our low-carbon energy transition. Events like the WSED connect them.</p>

<table summary=""""> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""342"" height=""114"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/595c054c1d.png"" width=""800"" style="""" /></th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>


<h3>Rolling up the sleeves</h3>
<h4>If you look at ongoing projects, what do you think could be the next groundbreaking innovation?</h4>
<p>In the past, we’ve always been looking for that one thing that’s going to be the ground breaker. When I was younger, we thought it was going to be nuclear energy. It turned out it isn’t. After the first oil crisis, people like Jimmy Carter thought that Renewables would do the trick fast. But well, it has taken a little longer. &nbsp;But I seriously believe the groundbreaker is in our using the full range of measures in a well-designed, well-thought through manner. I’m afraid there is no single technology that will achieve everything. So, we need to roll up our sleeves and keep plugging away.</p>
<h4>What can organizations like Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes do?</h4>
<p>As for EEIP, we started in 2011 and built up a community from scratch. There was nothing on that topic at EU level. We now have about a hundred and forty thousand people following us on different channels of social media. There’s great interest.</p>
<p>We publish a free magazine three times a year together with a partner. They print 25,000 copies that go to the factory floors.</p>
<p>We made big gains right now. But we also need to go beyond the question of industry and look at smart cities for example. We are also looking at new technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence.</p>
<h4>What would be the promise of your organization, the EEIP? Or your personal promise?</h4>
<p>We moved apartments last December, and there were 50 halogen lights in the ceiling in the place. I put all LEDs in there. It comes naturally to me because my father was Dutch and my mother was Scottish (laughs.)</p>
<p>As an organization, we’re very small but we try to be good sustainable corporate citizens. We all come to work on public transport, and last week my Fitbit watch registered that I normally walk or run about 80 km each week.</p>
<p>But on EU and global level we can provide a platform for people to express how they do work on energy efficiency and how they want to do things in the future.</p>
<h3>Meet the World and the EU at one event</h3>
<h4>You have also been an active supporter of the WSED efforts to promote the work of young researchers for a while. Why do you think it’s worthwhile to attend the young researchers conference?</h4>
<p>I don’t know of any other event in Europe that does this for young researchers and I think this is fundamentally important. I’ve been on the scientific committee for many years now to evaluate the papers that come in from the young researchers. But people like me are not going to be the analysts in 2050. We have to build up new generations of researchers. They bring fresh ideas, new methodologies and new ways of expressing things.</p>
<p>And for them it is important to be able to showcase what they’ve done at an event like WSED. I give full credit for WSED for doing this.</p>
<h4>How does your work benefit from it? What is different, when you come back?</h4>
<p>When I was invited to the World Sustainable Energy Days the first time, I had no idea what to expect. But I was quite intrigued and I loved the Trade Fair that goes along with it. And I liked the people who I met. We had the most interesting discussions from morning to night.</p>
<p>You meet people from Portugal, from Bulgaria or from Romania. You’ll see a speaker from Sweden and then the next is from Italy or from Canada. This is fantastic.</p>
<p>In Brussels, the members of the European Parliament and the people from the European Commission are running around like crazy. But in Wels, they are relaxed and you can talk to them. This is the one time you get to talk to them as human beings.</p>
<p>I have been in the game for a long time and I should be a little more jaded about it, but I do get excited.</p>
<p>Christiane and her team just keep going and have managed to put Wels and Upper Austria on the map. They had participants from 66 countries last year. That’s indeed quite impressive. And to top it all, there’s Austrian food.</p>

1193,"2018 Energy Trends: Connected Lighting is the Future (Part 1)",NULL,NULL,"<p>First published <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://blogs.dnvgl.com/energy/2018-energy-trends-connected-lighting-is-the-future"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2018 may well be the coming out party for connected lighting. </strong>Connected lighting holds tons of promise – from allowing utilities to lower M&amp;V costs to integrating Automated Demand Response (ADR) at the product level. <strong>However, a skeptical public is holding its pocket book tightly–largely unaware of these systems’ full value</strong>. Utilities, implementers, manufacturers and distributors all need to engage their customers in a way that presents the full spectrum of value. That means leaving the energy savings comfort zone and directly addressing Non-Energy Impacts (NEI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>With more influence than any specific trend I identify below, <strong>2018 will be a year of education and customer nurturing</strong>. Utilities looking to capitalize on these emerging trends should help seed their marketplaces by offering technical and value based trainings that communicate the range of value specific to unique customer segments. This is the first part of a 2-Part series where we will examine four trends in Smart Lighting.</p>
<h3>The Trends:</h3>
<p><strong>One Protocol to Rule Them All!</strong></p>
<p>One major barrier holding back connected lighting is the lack of a common protocol. Mixing protocols requires the use of gateways and increases the chance of interoperability issues on a project. Besides these basic obstacles, technologies that lack a standard protocol are perceived as immature and unreliable.</p>
<p>When we examine the marketplace today, we find&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://blogs.dnvgl.com/energy/explaining-the-jargon-behind-the-internet-of-things"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">lighting systems</a>&nbsp;using DALI, DMX, Zigbee, Lifi, PoE, etc. While every protocol has its pros and cons, a lack of a standard creates confusion in the marketplace.</p>
<p>In 2018, we will take a big first step in erasing this confusion through the recent adoption of Bluetooth mesh standards. Bluetooth has many structural advantages – none larger than the fact that everyone is carrying a Bluetooth gateway in their pocket in the form of a smartphone. Over time, Bluetooth will win the protocol war and become the standard for wireless communication of connected lighting systems. As the industry begins to standardize around the Bluetooth mesh protocol, customers will see the simplicity and reliability of the products and begin to demand connected lighting in greater numbers.</p>
<h3>Lighting beyond illumination:</h3>
<p>The Driver –&nbsp;Top-tier lighting OEMs are seeing their sales flatten or decline among traditional channel partners, like electrical distribution. The erosion of this market is most likely related to these traditional partners seeking out value lines that allow them to sure up their own margins.</p>
<p>The reaction/strategies –&nbsp;Two diverse trends occurring in the commercial lighting markets in early 2018 – one is a race to the bottom and another is a race to the top.</p>
<ul> 	<li>Race to the bottom: reactions from the top-tier OEMs have been to produce new classes of LED products that have fewer features and are of lower quality. This is the one trend I see going into 2018 that gives me the most pause for the connected lighting market. With this approach, lighting is viewed as a commodity and competing on price is a sound strategy.</li> 	<li>Race to the top: OEMs are adding functionality to luminaires to differentiate themselves and command higher prices. Fixtures integrated with sensors, network access points and color tuning capabilities simplify implementing a connected lighting solution. In the long run, the fixtures that offer value beyond illumination may be preferable to building owners, because if they decide that they need a connected lighting platform, they already will have the physical infrastructure in place. While the&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.acuityads.com/programmatic-marketing-platform/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">Artirus platform by Acuity</a>&nbsp;has a limited number of users today – Acuity has over 1 billion sq./ft. of networked lighting that is presently installed—this platform and similar ones on the market will become more prevalent. This is one of the reasons that I feel very optimistic about the future of connected lighting.</li> </ul>
<p>As an industry, we can begin to capitalize on these trends by educating our customer base on total value. Technological standardizations will lower barriers to entry by removing hurdles associated with interoperability and interference. Human-centric design will allow more people to experience the full value of smart lighting first hand. However, before we can transform the marketplace, we need to educate and nurture it.</p>

1200,"Cheaper Storage, Bigger Markets, Lots of EVs… Are you Ready?",NULL,NULL,"
<p>Davion Hill, first published <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://blogs.dnvgl.com/energy/cheaper-storage-bigger-markets-lots-of-evs-are-you-ready"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here.</a></p>
<p>We’ve talked a lot about falling energy storage costs, and you’ve heard me say cost reductions of 8-15% per year have been the historical norm, at least for the last decade. But you might have been wondering, like me, how long this can last? After all, the basic materials cost is the price floor, right?</p>
<p>It may be that the cost reduction rate is slowing down, but it still has plenty of room for continued reductions over the next decade. <strong>There are several factors that will drive down cost</strong>:</p>
<ol> 	<li>Scale from the electric vehicle (EV) markets which drives lower unit costs</li> 	<li>Increases in energy density within the same form factor through incremental manufacturing optimization</li> </ol>
<p><strong>Stationary storage benefits from the larger EV market</strong> by sharing not only the same&nbsp;battery cells&nbsp;across platforms, but also by sharing the same&nbsp;modules&nbsp;and&nbsp;packs. When modules and packs are shared across platforms the greatest pricing reductions are observed.</p>
<p><strong>Further reduction in the balance of plant</strong> – the containers, racks, PCS, and additional pieces to package a system — will reduce cost further. And then significant cost reductions are achieved by reducing the manufacturing of that balance of plant to the most automated, modular, repeatable, and reliable package possible.</p>
<p><strong>So back to one of our initial questions: what is the price floor?</strong> If the 8-15% cost reductions continued, we’d be at $100/kWh system costs by 2022. If cost reductions are slowing (but still decreasing), it is completely feasible to imagine $200-$250/kWh AC system costs by 2022. Cell costs will most assuredly be at $100/kWh by then, and $100/kWh system costs by 2030. One might assume the cost reduction rate is slowing to 6-8% YOY.</p>
<p>NYSERDA recently published their&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All%20Programs/Programs/Energy%20Storage/Achieving%20NY%20Energy%20Goals/The%20New%20York%20State%20Energy%20Storage%20Roadmap"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window"">Energy Storage Roadmap</a>&nbsp;and did a break-even cost analysis of a number of applications, many of which were between $500-$1000/kWh installed. That means that today, AC system costs are already enabling those markets. &nbsp;<strong>The last frontier of cost reductions that manufacturers can’t control is the installed costs.</strong> Right now the market is being led by engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractors who provide assurance to developers and lenders with long term service agreements. In those agreements there may be guarantees associated with replacements and maintenance, availability and uptime, and energy capacity, power, or efficiency. When these EPC’s can get their construction costs down to a modular structure just like the systems they are installing, we’ll see further declines on the installed cost.</p>
<p>It used to be that there was a value in having a long life battery because it may pencil out to be a lower cost over the system life due to lack of replacements or augmentations. That notion has since been challenged, given that Li-ion is the cheapest storage in the marketplace and its future cost is even cheaper. However, as prices get lower, the maintenance and O&amp;M cost becomes an increasingly larger portion of the overall cost. Will O&amp;M also get lower, or higher?</p>
<p>DNV GL’s prediction is that it will stay the same or increase. Once EPC’s and manufacturers become comfortable with acknowledging replacements and augmentations in pricing, and they can transparently plan for those costs in their sales and service models, developers and banks will embrace that as part of the model and assume that replacements are a cost of doing business.</p>
<p>That’s where it’s going. See you there.</p>

1203,"The Investor Confidence Project: The Time is Now",Finance,NULL,"
<p>The end of the year normally makes us</p>
<p>reflect on where we are and how we got there. In the past couple of months, we</p>
<p>have been shocked by a special report from the Intergovernmental Panel for</p>
<p>Climate Change. If we go beyond a 1.5°C increase in global temperature, the</p>
<p>impact will be dire. Since then more and more evidence has come forward, most</p>
<p>recently at the latest global climate conference in Katowice, Poland.</p>



<p>Commentators are saying that the next two</p>
<p>years are crucial to really get everything in motion to effectively lower</p>
<p>emissions to achieve the necessary impact.</p>


<h3>So, what are we to do?</h3>


<p>Sometimes we feel we are in a movie about</p>
<p>the apocalypse with all the news about climate change and the environment.&nbsp; But we cannot afford to be negative when</p>
<p>there are positive ways forward and there is so much to do. A year ago,</p>
<p>Professor Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker and Anders Wijkman published their report</p>
<p>for the Club of Rome entitled “Come On!” The title gives an indication of the</p>
<p>direction they are moving – fast forward. They argue that the human footprint</p>
<p>is increasing fast and, if not reversed, will eventually lead to a collapse of</p>
<p>the global economy. This book is</p>
<p>far from doom and gloom. It is full of optimistic case studies and policy</p>
<p>proposals that will lead us back to a trajectory of sustainability. The book offers many positive, practical examples, success stories</p>
<p>and opportunities.</p>


<p>Yes, there is a way forward.</p>

<h3>Only a year ago . . .</h3>


<p>The concept of ICP is relatively simple to</p>
<p>understand. A potential project in a factory or a district heating system, for</p>
<p>example, is identified. Someone has to do the necessary calculations to</p>
<p>determine the viability. Someone has to be identified to install it (often the</p>
<p>same organisation). And some organisation needs to fund it. What this project</p>
<p>does is standardise the procedures so that all players gain confidence in the</p>
<p>system. The factory owner is happy. The developer/auditor/installer is happy.</p>
<p>The financial institution is happy. There are protocols in place and third-party</p>
<p>monitoring to ensure everything is done correctly. The protocols are developed</p>
<p>by interested experts and not by commercial interests.</p>



<p>Just over a year ago, I wrote (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/articles/detailed/57e0c8928b53c5f290c0cb5bf8ece94d/onward-we-go-starting-the-credentialing-process-for-icp-europe-industry-projects/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">here</a>) about the Technical Forum that helped the technical team from the Investor</p>
<p>Confidence Project Europe prepare a protocol for industry. The protocol would</p>
<p>be used in the eventual accreditation of a project.</p>



<p>Well, a lot has happened in the past</p>
<p>year.&nbsp; The protocols were developed for</p>
<p>industry and xxx as well as for streetlighting. There have been several</p>
<p>training sessions to get project developers up to speed on our approach and to</p>
<p>get them credentialed so that they can use our methodology.</p>


<h3>Reviewing the ICP approach</h3>


<p>ICP's Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™</p>
<p>(IREE™) is an international certification that insures best practices, the</p>
<p>right professionals and third-party validation are used to deliver high-quality</p>
<p>projects that you can bank on.</p>



<p>The IREE™ certification is based on the ICP</p>
<p>framework, which assembles best practices and existing technical standards into</p>
<p>a set of Protocols that define a clear roadmap for developing projects, determining</p>
<p>savings estimates, and documenting and verifying results.</p>



<p><strong>The ICP Protocols are now available on the</strong></p>
<p><strong><a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/protocols.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">ICP website</a>.</strong></p>



<p>The process is described in the Protocols</p>
<p>and the Project Development Specification documents. The PDS provides a clear</p>
<p>roadmap for Project Developers to correctly implement each requirement</p>
<p>specified in the ICP protocols based on current best practices and available</p>
<p>resources. It represents the collective project development knowledge of a</p>
<p>large team of experts and has been designed to allow various stakeholders to</p>
<p>develop projects that meet a consistent level of quality and conform to the ICP</p>
<p>Protocols.&nbsp; As with all of ICP's</p>
<p>offerings the Project Development Specification is a living document and ICP</p>
<p>seeks the continuing input of all stakeholders.</p>

<h3>Latest developments</h3>


<p>It takes time to get a project like ICP up</p>
<p>and running but we have made great progress in the past year and a half of the</p>
<p>project, funded by the European Commission.</p>



<p>ICP is now finalising the first two</p>
<p>projects accredited under the project. This is a major step, given that there</p>
<p>are many financial institutions that are part of our investor</p>
<p>network, willing to provide financing for projected that gain our label. In</p>
<p>coming weeks, I will provide details on the projects that have made it through</p>
<p>our system.</p>

<h3>Final words</h3>


<p>The IPCC report and the recent global</p>
<p>climate conference in Poland, amongst others, have given us many reasons why we</p>
<p>need to take action. Asset owners need to look at what needs to be done to</p>
<p>improve energy performance and thus reduce emissions – and save money.&nbsp; Project developers need to better promote</p>
<p>what they can do to realise those projects.</p>



<p>ICP can help. ICP was brought to Europe to</p>
<p>develop a system to give confidence to all active stakeholders. There are still</p>
<p>concerns that investing in energy efficiency is risky. ICP is designed to</p>
<p>change that. ICP started with investments in buildings and has now broadened the</p>
<p>scope to include industry, district energy and street lighting through a</p>
<p>two-year project funded by the European Commission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, these are early stages but we need to</p>
<p>start somewhere and the ICP, in its relatively short history, has shown its</p>
<p>worth.</p>



<p>Yes, we are reading daily about the</p>
<p>critical period we are in concerning growing GHG emissions. We cannot simply</p>
<p>watch or read the news and leave it to others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all must do our part.&nbsp; If you</p>
<p>are a project developer, consider joining our network.&nbsp; If you are an asset owner, large or small,</p>
<p>consider having your planned energy efficiency measure implemented through our</p>
<p>approach.&nbsp; And if you are even at the</p>
<p>early stages of thinking about improving the energy performance of your</p>
<p>facility, give us a chance to explain how the ICP approach will be of great</p>
<p>advantage to you.</p>



<p>Much progress was made in 2018 but we need</p>
<p>even more in 2019 and beyond. There is a good foundation but the progress</p>
<p>depends on you now.</p>



<p>Yes, there are many good reasons to stay positive.</p>
<p>Now we need you to take the next step. The time is now. And we can help.</p>

"
1204,"The Times Are A-Changin’",NULL,NULL,"<p><br /> In 1964, Bob Dylan wrote one of those classic songs that have remained powerful over the years. He wrote the song as a deliberate attempt to create an anthem of change for the time. What does this mean for us in the early days of 2019? It seems as if we are in the midst of constant change and constant concern about change. While there is much we can’t control, there is also much we can.</p>
<p>Let’s just take climate change and what reducing our energy consumption will mean. According to the 2018 special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we are not doing enough. If we go beyond a 1.5°C increase in global temperature, the impact will be dire. Reducing emissions through reducing our energy consumption is one of the key ways forward. And reducing consumption through improved energy efficiency is fundamental, as you all know.<br /> <br /> We have to find every way possible to mitigate those emissions. Fortunately, the European Commission has funded some projects to help de-risk energy efficiency projects. I am involved in the Investor Confidence Project (ICP) and we are working in the areas of industry, street lighting and district energy.<br /> <br /> The concept of ICP is relatively simple to understand. It is designed to facilitate the relationship between asset owners and developers by setting up a standardised system that can be monitored, thus giving confidence to those two groups as well as the financial community that is needed to eventually fund the projects.<br /> <br /> A potential project in a factory or a district heating system, for example, is identified. Someone has to do the necessary calculations to determine the viability. Someone has to be identified to install it (often the same organisation). And some organisation needs to fund it.

1205,"Waste Heat Recovery - first European industry project certified by the Investor Confidence Project",NULL,NULL,"<p>VIENNA/LONDON, January 2019. The Investor Confidence Project's innovative Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ Certification has been awarded to a waste heat utilisation project at GMS GOURMET GmbH. The project uses waste heat of two fast cooling plants to support the heating demand of three ventilation systems at GOURMET's production site in Vienna and thereby saves natural gas and electricity.</p>

<p><em>""Managing Director Hannes Hasibar emphasizes GOURMET's leadership </em></p>
<p><em>when it comes to energy efficiency and innovation: ""As a responsible </em></p>
<p><em>company we treat the earth's natural resources with care and </em></p>
<p><em>continuously work on improving efficiency and standards.""</em></p>

<p>GOURMET's appetite for innovation goes hand in hand with ICP Europe's new Investor Ready Energy Efficiency (IREETM) Certification for industry which delivers high quality projects and safer returns by standardizing how energy efficiency projects are developed, documented and measured.</p>
<p>Convinced of the benefits of ICP, energy efficiency specialist denkstatt &amp; enertec became the first registered ICP project developer for industry projects and - together with Austrian ICP partner denkstatt - accompanied GOURMET to have its waste heat recovery project certified as the first industrial project in Europe.</p>

<p><em>""Managing Director Christian Schuetzenhofer: ""The application of ICP through denkstatt &amp; enertec gives the project owner even more robust, independently verified savings calculations and an additional level of quality assurance. Moreover, it puts more focus on proper project implementation in addition to project development.""</em></p>
<p>The project has predicted annual energy savings of 635 MWh in natural gas and 135 MWh in electricity. As project developer, denkstatt &amp; enertec provided the underlying baselining and energy savings calculations and developed implementation plans for Operational Performance Verification (OPV), Operations, Maintenance &amp; Monitoring (OM&amp;M) and Measurement &amp; Verification (M&amp;V) processes. Working closely with denkstatt &amp; enertec, the project's quality assurance assessor and technical ICP partner Verco applied the ICP Europe Complex Industry Protocol to certify the project.</p>
<p><strong>ICP framework is now also available in German and ready to deliver high-quality projects</strong></p>
<p><em>""ICP Europe Senior Advisor Steve Fawkes: ""The ICP framework assembles best practices and existing technical standards into a set of Protocols that define a clear roadmap for developing projects, determining savings estimates, and documenting and verifying results. GOURMET's IREE-certified project shows that our framework - which has been successfully applied to multiple buildings projects in the past - also delivers high-quality industrial projects that the project owner can bank on.""</em></p>
<p>The ICP Protocols and accompanying tools and templates are published as open-source documents (<a href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/protocols.html"">http://europe.eeperformance.org/protocols.html</a>) ready to be used in energy efficiency projects in industry &amp; energy supply and street lighting projects across Europe. Since November, the Protocols are also available in German to facilitate the application of ICP in Austria and Germany. Free online trainings for interested project developers and quality assurance assessors are regularly offered.</p>
<p><em>""Willibald Kaltenbrunner, Managing Partner of Austrian ICP partner denkstatt: ""This project's insights show that the additional benefit of applying ICP usually outweighs any additional effort that is needed. We hope to see more businesses following GOURMET's pioneering role and are happy to support Austrian project owners and developers working on high-quality industrial energy efficiency projects.

1209,"Finding our voice",NULL,NULL,"<p>We communicate in many ways. Often it is in our voice, but it can be in our actions, our body language, our facial expressions, our writings and so on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I was a speaker at the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://www.wsed.at/en/programme/industrial-energy-efficiency-conference.html"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window""><strong>Industrial Energy Efficiency Conference at World Sustainable Energy Days</strong></a>. While WSED has been going on for about 25 years, this was the first time it had dedicated a conference to industrial concerns. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am President of <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes (EEIP)</a> and we have about 140,000 in our network.&nbsp; We pride ourselves in being a neutral platform, but we have a voice and we do what we can to promote the importance of improved industrial energy efficiency throughout Europe. For that reason, we jumped at the opportunity when I was asked to speak at WSED. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The industrial energy efficiency conference is half a day long, part of a three-day set of conferences on biomass, energy efficiency and young researchers in both energy efficiency and biomass. There were many good speakers on various technical and policy aspects of industrial energy efficiency and then there was a group of short interventions in a section called the voices. Bless the organisers for such an idea. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The voices represented various companies and industry associations (e.g. heat pumps) that could anchor ideas in the real world.&nbsp; Excellent. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I was the second last speaker and nothing is more stirring than testing your own thoughts against that what one has just heard.&nbsp; Well, I realised my PowerPoint presentation was going to be too pedestrian and I really wanted to stir things up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my main theme was about the voice.&nbsp; Yes, many of you will associate it with a singing competition and you would be right to think so. Of course, I did as well (without the singing). I brought it back to the recently approved EU clean energy package that gave a new target for energy savings for 2030. I brought it back to the late <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://report.ipcc.ch/sr15/pdf/sr15_spm_final.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">2018 special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> that stated we have no choice but to remain below 1.5 degrees C to ensure that the world that we know is not doomed. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Investor Confidence Project &nbsp;</h3>

<p>It is necessary to stay positive or else we are really doomed.&nbsp; I mentioned an important project that EEIP is a partner in – the <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://europe.eeperformance.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Investor Confidence Project for industry, streetlighting and district energy</a>. Have a look at our <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">EEIP website</a> and my <a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.ee-ip.org/articles/detailed/8df8bd03b30afa5e3581a4eec35f748c/the-investor-confidence-project-the-time-is-now/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">umpteen blogs</a>, but essentially it is designed to <strong>“de-risk” projects in order to give the asset owner and the financial community more confidence in both undertaking an energy efficiency project and financing it</strong>. No project is risk-free but the process to standardise a relationship between the asset owner and the project developer (often an energy service company) with third-party quality assurance, goes a long way to build confidence. Yes, there are other important non-legislative initiatives in industry, but ICP is definitely one of the leaders. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I challenged the audience that they have to raise their voice. It cannot be a not-for-profit organisation in Brussels.&nbsp; It cannot be an annual conference in Wels, Austria. It has to be every one of us.&nbsp; And at all times, and in all occasions. We cannot keep speaking only to our little community (even if 140,000 is not that small). &nbsp; It is encouraging to see what the youth have done globally to raise their voice that they are not at all happy with what our generation has done to address climate change. We may live in a more limited sphere, but that only presents us with more of a challenge. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You will continue to hear from me and EEIP and please add yourself to our network. We welcome everyone to come to the next industrial energy efficiency conference at WSED. We also ask you to take a look at ICP and see how it can work for you. Yes, and how you can work for it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no silver bullet to addressing climate change. This is not an easy challenge. We need you to work with us. &nbsp;</p>

1210,"Utilize all the available energy — Heat recovery",NULL,NULL,"<p>Today, global industry consumes a vast amount of energy. The biggest challenge is that as much as half of it is wasted due to the inefficient and complicated recovery of low-grade energy. Heat in the form of vapor, hot water, or hot air is a result of almost any production cycle, but it does not have to go to waste. With smarter systems, it can be recovered and reused for other purposes, contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions and to significant cost savings for both producers and end users.</p>
<p><br /> Brazed Plate Heat Exchanger (BPHE) technology offers the most efficient recovery of heat across a range of industrial applications, including Process and Comfort cooling Chillers, Combined Heat and Power and compressed air systems.<br /> &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Utilize the high-temperature energy of superheated refrigerant gas</h2>

<p>Industrial refrigeration systems with air-cooled condensers waste energy by emitting condensation energy to the ambient air. By installing a desuperheater, much of this waste energy can be converted to hot water, with a wide range of applications.<br /> Brazed Plate Heat Exchangers (BPHEs) are an integral tool that allow extra heat to be extracted from the refrigeration system. A BPHE, called a desuperheater, is inserted between the compressor and the condenser. This enables the BPHE to extract the heat from the gases or liquids before it goes into the condenser to be condensate (the liquid collected by condensation).<br /> <br /> Installing a BPHE increases efficiency levels to help achieve the demanding recent EU Ecodesign Directive that cover high temperature process chillers. Evaporators can operate at a range of temperature levels to meet the required demands for a variety of refrigerants.<br /> Using clean, processed water is essential to prolong the life of all industrial components and is necessary to achieve maximum performance from BPHEs.</p>
<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""305"" height=""267"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/a8b7009a4e.jpg"" width=""300"" style="""" /></th> 			<th scope=""col"">&nbsp;</th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>
<p><br /> BPHEs offer copper brazing as standard but also stainless and nickel as alternative brazing materials in order to meet the demands for various corrosive fluids.<br /> &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Simultaneous production of electricity with the recovery and utilization of heat</h2>

<p>Traditional cogeneration systems produce electric power at around 40% efficiency, so there is a lot of waste. A way to improve efficiency is to install cogeneration systems that produce electricity and heat simultaneously. Such plants are called CHP - Combined Heat and Power.<br /> <br /> CHP plants are usually built around a gas engine genset. They collect thermal energy from an intercooler, engine jacket water, lubrication oil, and exhaust gas. Hot water can then be produced via heat exchangers, increasing total energy utilization efficiency, often to a level in excess of 90% efficiency.</p>

<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""306"" height=""311"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/26717f775e.jpg"" width=""300"" style="""" /></th> 			<th scope=""col"">&nbsp;</th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>
<p>Some CHP plants are connected through an ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle) system where the waste heat of the engine is used to drive the generator. CHP plants are typically embedded close to the end user and therefore help reduce transportation and distribution losses, improving the overall performance of the electricity transmission and distribution network.<br /> &nbsp;</p>











<h3 class=""western"">&nbsp;</h3>
<h2>Reclaim more energy from compressed air systems</h2>

<p>Some 10% of all electricity used in industry derives from compressed air systems. And around 94% of this energy is converted to heat that is not wanted or needed. So with inefficient systems that do not have a heat recovery capability, energy is first used to generate heat and then more energy is consumed to remove the heat using cooling fans. And often there can be several processes producing waste heat within the same facility.<br /> <br /> The heat recovery capability of a compressed air system is therefore vital. BPHE technology enables users to transfer the waste heat to different parts of the production chain or to an exterior facility, utilizing almost all the energy produced. Other advantages of BPHEs include their compact size, increased efficiency and reliability.</p>
<table> 	<thead> 		<tr> 			<th scope=""col""><img alt="""" data-htmlarea-file-uid=""307"" height=""267"" src=""fileadmin/user_upload/IMAGES/Articles/bc6fffbfa5.jpg"" width=""300"" style="""" /></th> 			<th scope=""col"">&nbsp;</th> 		</tr> 	</thead> 	<tbody> 	</tbody> </table>

<p>The reduction in wasted energy combined with lowered utility costs optimizes the payback period, so that in many instances it can be as short as six months. Businesses that choose to install a heat-recovery solution for their compressed air systems achieve significant cost savings while also lowering CO emissions.<br /> <br /> <br /> Brazed Plate Heat Exchangers are virtually maintenance-free, with reduced lifecycle costs compared to other heat exchanger technologies while offering the most efficient recovery of heat across a range of industrial applications. In many cases, the reduction in wasted energy combined with lowered utility costs optimizes the payback period. This can be as short as six months.</p>

<p>Financial Institutions and Energy Efficiency</p>
<p>This section sets out the reasons why financial institutions are, or should be, active in energy efficiency financing. These include; a large and growing market opportunity, risk reduction, Corporate Social Responsibility, and growing interest from financial regulators.</p>
<p>KEY POINTS</p>
<p>Leading financial institutions are active in energy efficiency for four main reasons:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li>it represents a significant new business opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>it can reduce client risk through improving cash flow and reducing the risk of stranded assets through tightening energy efficiency regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>it delivers environmental objectives which are a key component of Corporate Social Responsibility programmes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>banking regulators are increasingly looking at climate risks and energy efficiency is a major factor in mitigating those risks.</li> </ul>
<p>These four reasons should encourage other financial institutions to enter the market.</p>
<p>RECOMMENDATIONS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li>Assess the market potential for energy efficiency in key client sectors addressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Assess current and future legislative and regulatory environment for energy efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Identify any support mechanisms – either government grants or financial instruments such as guarantee mechanisms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Assign senior management responsibility to drive product development.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Product design needs to be proactive, systematic and address the drivers of demand as well as the provision of capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Encourage and assist clients to identify cost-effective energy efficiency improvements which go beyond business-as-usual when considering normal investments such as building refurbishments or new building construction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Ensure energy efficiency loans and investments are tagged to enable future tracking and measurement of risk and environmental impacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Ensure energy efficiency products use best practice technical processes including the use of internationally recognised standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Assess potential for improving energy efficiency within own property portfolio and use to develop products and build capacity.</li> </ul>
<p>DISCUSSION</p>
<p>Although there are pools of private sector capital financing energy efficiency projects and programmes, outside of those programmes promoted by multi-lateral development and policy banks (all of which have had a long interest in energy efficiency), these can be considered pioneering or early adopters. Interest and engagement of private finance in energy efficiency was limited until the last decade as the majority of energy financing has been focused on renewable energy and other energy generating assets. Despite growing interest in energy efficiency, aided and supported by the activities of institutions such as the Energy Efficiency Financial Institution Group (EEFIG) and the G20 Energy Efficiency Finance Task Force, the levels of investment to date fall short of both what is possible and what is needed to meet Europe’s energy and climate targets. Financial institutions, both lenders and investors, can take positive action to accelerate the flow of capital into this important area which can be both profitable and address key areas of corporate and systemic risk.</p>
<p>Four reasons to be interested in energy efficiency</p>
<p>There are four reasons why financial institutions should consider deploying capital into energy efficiency:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li>energy efficiency represents a large potential market. The IEA estimates that in 2015 global investment in energy efficiency was USD 221 billion with approximately USD 32 billion being financed through explicit energy efficiency mechanisms such as Energy Performance Contracts or green bonds. To achieve our climate goals this level of investment needs to grow to circa USD 1 trillion per annum by 2050 and the provision of finance can help overcome some of the barriers to energy efficiency investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>reducing risks in two ways. Firstly, increasing energy efficiency improves the cash flow of clients, thus reducing their risk. Secondly there is the risk of financing assets that become stranded as energy efficiency regulations are tightened. For example, in England &amp; Wales it will become unlawful to lease a commercial building with an Energy Performance Certificate rating below E on 1st April 2018. This puts owners of low performing buildings, and their lenders, at risk.</li> </ul>

<h3><strong>DEUTSCH (DEEPL translation)</strong></h3>
<p><br /> Finanzinstitute und Energieeffizienz</p>
<p>In diesem Abschnitt werden die Gründe dargelegt, warum Finanzinstitute bei der Finanzierung von Energieeffizienz aktiv sind oder sein sollten. Dazu gehören: eine große und wachsende Marktchance, Risikominderung, Corporate Social Responsibility und das wachsende Interesse der Finanzaufsichtsbehörden.</p>
<p>KEY POINTS</p>
<p>Führende Finanzinstitute sind in der Energieeffizienz aus vier Hauptgründen aktiv:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li>es stellt eine bedeutende neue Geschäftsmöglichkeit dar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Es kann das Kundenrisiko reduzieren, indem es den Cashflow verbessert und das Risiko von gestrandeten Anlagen durch strengere Energieeffizienzanforderungen reduziert.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Sie erfüllt Umweltziele, die eine Schlüsselkomponente der Programme zur sozialen Verantwortung der Unternehmen sind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Die Bankaufsichtsbehörden befassen sich zunehmend mit Klimarisiken, und die Energieeffizienz ist ein wesentlicher Faktor bei der Minderung dieser Risiken.</li> </ul>
<p>Diese vier Gründe sollten andere Finanzinstitute ermutigen, in den Markt einzusteigen.</p>
<p>EMPFEHLUNGEN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li>Bewertung des Marktpotenzials für Energieeffizienz in den angesprochenen Schlüsselkundensektoren.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Bewertung des derzeitigen und künftigen rechtlichen und regulatorischen Umfelds für Energieeffizienz.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Identifizieren Sie alle Unterstützungsmechanismen - entweder staatliche Zuschüsse oder Finanzinstrumente wie z.B. Garantiemechanismen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Übertragen Sie der Geschäftsleitung die Verantwortung für die Produktentwicklung.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Das Produktdesign muss proaktiv, systematisch und auf die Treiber der Nachfrage sowie der Bereitstellung von Kapital ausgerichtet sein.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Ermutigung und Unterstützung der Kunden bei der Identifizierung kosteneffizienter Energieeffizienzverbesserungen, die über das normale Geschäft hinausgehen, wenn es um normale Investitionen wie Gebäudesanierungen oder Neubauten geht.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Sicherstellen, dass Energieeffizienzkredite und -investitionen gekennzeichnet sind, um eine zukünftige Verfolgung und Messung von Risiken und Umweltauswirkungen zu ermöglichen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Sicherstellen, dass energieeffiziente Produkte bewährte technische Verfahren verwenden, einschließlich der Verwendung international anerkannter Normen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 	<li>Bewertung von Potenzialen zur Verbesserung der Energieeffizienz im eigenen Immobilienportfolio und Nutzung für die Entwicklung von Produkten und den Kapazitätsaufbau.</li> </ul>
<p>DISKUSSION</p>
<p>Obwohl es Pools von privatwirtschaftlichen Kapitalgebern gibt, die Projekte und Programme zur Energieeffizienz finanzieren, können diese außerhalb der Programme, die von multilateralen Entwicklungs- und Politikbanken gefördert werden (die alle seit langem ein Interesse an der Energieeffizienz haben), als Pionier- oder Early Adopters betrachtet werden. Das Interesse und das Engagement privater Finanzmittel für die Energieeffizienz war bis zum letzten Jahrzehnt begrenzt, da sich der Großteil der Energiefinanzierung auf erneuerbare Energien und andere Energieerzeugungsanlagen konzentriert hat. Trotz des wachsenden Interesses an Energieeffizienz, unterstützt und unterstützt durch die Aktivitäten von Institutionen wie der Energy Efficiency Financial Institution Group (EEFIG) und der G20 Energy Efficiency Finance Task Force, bleibt das Investitionsvolumen bisher hinter dem zurück, was möglich ist und was erforderlich ist, um die europäischen Energie- und Klimaziele zu erreichen. Finanzinstitute, sowohl Kreditgeber als auch Investoren, können positive Maßnahmen ergreifen, um den Kapitalfluss in diesen wichtigen Bereich zu beschleunigen, der sowohl profitabel sein als auch Schlüsselbereiche des Unternehmens- und Systemrisikos abdecken kann.</p>
<p>Vier Gründe, sich für Energieeffizienz zu interessieren</p>
<p>Es gibt vier Gründe, warum Finanzinstitute den Einsatz von Kapital für die Energieeffizienz in Betracht ziehen sollten:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul> 	<li>Energieeffizienz stellt ein großes Marktpotenzial dar. Die IEA schätzt, dass die weltweiten Investitionen in die Energieeffizienz im Jahr 2015 221 Milliarden US-Dollar betrugen, wobei rund 32 Milliarden US-Dollar durch explizite Energieeffizienzmechanismen wie Energy Performance Contracts oder Green Bonds finanziert wurden. Um unsere Klimaziele zu erreichen, muss dieses Investitionsniveau bis 2050 auf ca. 1 Billion USD pro Jahr ansteigen, und die Bereitstellung von Finanzmitteln kann dazu beitragen, einige der Hindernisse für Investitionen in Energieeffizienz zu beseitigen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduzierung der Risiken auf zwei Arten. Erstens verbessert die Steigerung der Energieeffizienz den Cashflow der Kunden und reduziert so ihr Risiko.</li> 	<li>Zweitens besteht das Risiko der Finanzierung von Anlagen, die aufgrund verschärfter Energieeffizienzanforderungen gestrandet sind. So wird es beispielsweise in England &amp; Wales am 1. April 2018 rechtswidrig, ein Geschäftsgebäude mit einem Energieausweis unter E zu mieten. Dadurch sind Eigentümer von Gebäuden mit geringer Leistung und deren Kreditgeber gefährdet.</li> </ul>

1212,"Electric Vehicles & Heat Pumps: Electric motors play a crucial role in the energy transition",NULL,NULL,"





<p><em>Electric motors are implicated in two major decarbonisation</em></p>
<p><em>options involving electrification: electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps. This</em></p>
<p><em>will lead to a significant market growth, as well as growing responsibilities</em></p>
<p><em>concerning efficiency, flexibility and material use. </em></p>



<p>The electrical power sector is the fastest</p>
<p>to <a href=""http://eeip.webseiten.cc/"" name=""_Hlk516649167"">decarbonise</a> because of the wide variety of</p>
<p>carbon-free energy sources that can generate electricity, such as PV, wind and</p>
<p>hydro. This means that electrification can help other sectors decarbonise fast</p>
<p>and on a large scale. The share of electricity in gross final energy</p>
<p>consumption in the EU is expected to increase from the current 17% to around 60</p>
<p>- 70% in the coming 30 years. The major potential for electrification lies in</p>
<p>building heating and cooling, water heating, transport and various types of</p>
<p>industrial energy use. Most of these applications involve electric motors. As a</p>
<p>result, the share of electric motors systems will at the least grow along with</p>
<p>the electrification process, from the current 9% to around 30% of EU energy</p>
<p>end-use. With this strong market growth in view, the impact of motors on the</p>
<p>environment and on grid operation will also increase.</p>


<h2>The electrification of transport</h2>


<p>The transport sector is the largest</p>
<p>contributor to energy related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the EU-28. A</p>
<p>market breakthrough of electric vehicles (EVs) for private transport could lead</p>
<p>to a strong and immediate reduction of those emissions, as EVs have substantial</p>
<p>higher well-to-wheel efficiencies than cars with an internal combustion engine</p>
<p>(ICE) powered by fossil fuels. Moreover, there is a strong technological</p>
<p>incentive to further increase the energy efficiency of EV motors, since doing</p>
<p>so increases the driving range for a fixed battery capacity. And with the</p>
<p>lasting decarbonisation of the electrical power sector, the carbon emission</p>
<p>reductions achieved by EVs will continue to increase.</p>



<p>The majority of EV manufacturers currently</p>
<p>opt for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM). Other types of EV motors</p>
<p>include AC induction motors with copper rotors and synchronous wound field</p>
<p>motors. However, with the prospect of a future mass market, electric automotive</p>
<p>drives are the subject of intensive R&amp;D efforts, with – among others – a</p>
<p>focus on developing motors with reduced rare-earth content. Major improvements leading</p>
<p>to shifts between the preferred types of motor are to be expected in the coming</p>
<p>years.</p>


<h2>The electrification of HVAC</h2>


<p>One third of Europe’s GHG emissions can be</p>
<p>attributed to buildings, and much of this is related to heating and cooling. With the Energy Performance of</p>
<p>Buildings Directive (EPBD), the EU aims to decrease emissions from residential</p>
<p>and tertiary sector buildings by 88-91% by 2050 compared to the 1990 baseline. Since</p>
<p>the construction and renovation rates are low, a technology installed in a</p>
<p>building could remain for 30 to 40 years or more. This means that systems should</p>
<p>be designed with the future in mind, considering in particular the expected lasting</p>
<p>decrease of GHG emissions from electricity generation. The preferred type of</p>
<p>heating technology depends on many factors, but for</p>
<p>most dwellings, a local</p>
<p>heat pump or a highly decarbonized district heating system will be the preferred</p>
<p>options. Heat pumps rely on an electrically driven</p>
<p>compressor and can be used for both heating and cooling. Its technology is more</p>
<p>mature than that of Electric Vehicles, and no fundamental technological shifts</p>
<p>are to be expected in the near future. With EU regulations gradually evolving</p>
<p>towards imposing nearly-zero-energy buildings, the sector is stimulated to</p>
<p>further drive up the energy efficiency of heat pumps. Choosing the right</p>
<p>compressor load variation strategy plays an important role in this.</p>


<h2>Energy efficiency remains on the agenda</h2>


<p>The expected market growth for motor</p>
<p>systems makes it an effective decarbonisation path to further increase their efficiency</p>
<p>up to the level of the lowest life-cycle cost. Extending the Ecodesign MEPS to</p>
<p>other motor categories and removing some exceptions would be a logical next</p>
<p>step that could lead to significant carbon emission savings. Small and large</p>
<p>motors could be included, and the exceptions for brake motors and</p>
<p>explosion-proof motors could be removed, as well as the choice to opt for a</p>
<p>lower efficiency category if combined with a variable speed drive (VSD). Those</p>
<p>four steps would lead to a total saving of 22.3 TWh or 9.97 million tonnes of</p>
<p>CO<sub>2eq</sub> per year. For medium and large power motors, the minimum</p>
<p>efficiency level could be raised to IE4 from 2022 onwards. Doing so would be</p>
<p>economically sound and would save an additional 9.3 TWh and 4.16 million tonnes</p>
<p>of CO<sub>2eq</sub> per year.</p>



<p>The biggest energy savings potential,</p>
<p>however, lays probably in an approach that focusses on the entire motor system</p>
<p>instead of the isolated device. The disadvantage of such an “extended product</p>
<p>approach” is the difficulty to translate it into a workable regulation. A more</p>
<p>active promotion of standard IEC 61800-9, which takes the entire motor system</p>
<p>into account, would be useful, as well as the development of a software tool</p>
<p>that can assist in implementing this standard. Another – complementary – way</p>
<p>could be to promote system efficiency via the ISO 50001 standard on Energy</p>
<p>Management and its implementation guides.</p>


<h2>Shifting the consumption to moments of abundant production</h2>


<p>The growing share of grid-connected</p>
<p>renewable energy systems, which feature naturally variable output, makes the</p>
<p>task of grid operators increasingly complex. Electricity should not only be used</p>
<p>efficiently, its consumption should also be shifted as much as possible to</p>
<p>moments of abundant production. Some sectors with large numbers of motor</p>
<p>systems in use are well-equipped to offer this flexibility. These include building</p>
<p>HVAC (well-insulated rooms</p>
<p>represent a buffer capacity on their own), water management (driven</p>
<p>primarily by pump systems), and industrial process plants. Mechanisms should be put in place</p>
<p>to connect electricity users with grid operators so that such far-reaching</p>
<p>consumer engagement can be achieved.</p>


<h2>Motors in the circular economy</h2>


<p>Finally, the energy transition can only be sustainable</p>
<p>if material use is taken into account. With the Circular Economy Package, the</p>
<p>European Commission has also come to this conclusion. The expected increase in</p>
<p>the number of motors required during the energy transition leads us to the</p>
<p>question whether those motors have the potential to be part of the circular</p>
<p>economy.</p>



<p>If motors consist primarily of copper, steel and</p>
<p>aluminium, their depletion potential remains limited and their level of</p>
<p>recyclability high. Motors have been rewound and recycled for decades. Permanent</p>
<p>magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) contain various rare-earth metals that appear</p>
<p>on the EU list of critical raw materials and are therefore not recommended to</p>
<p>become a major part of the solution for emerging mass markets. Research &amp; Innovation support should focus on the development of</p>
<p>rare-earth-free drives.</p>



<p><em>Design for Recycling</em></p>
<p>(DfR) considers the technical and economic effort that is required to</p>
<p>recuperate as much material as possible during repair and overhaul and at the</p>
<p>end-of-life. It could be stimulated by providing the buyers of electric motors with</p>
<p>information on recyclability, e.g. through a Design for Recycling label.</p>



<p>Electric</p>
<p>motors look at a bright future. If they will manage to continue their feat of</p>
<p>continuous energy efficiency improvements while at the same time work towards a</p>
<p>responsible material use, free of rare-earth metals and incorporated into a</p>
<p>truly circular economy, they could become one of the major winners of the</p>
<p>energy transition.</p>

All essential ingredients in place, it is more a question on how to trigger decisions for efficiency. This is not in hope for more and more ambitious announcements of goals and targets – these we do have enough!</p>
<p>One, it is terribly tricky for legislators to grasp the needs of somethings such diverse as the industrial sector in terms of its energy productivity potentials; two, what is offered, often doesn’t really meet the needs adequately and is hence not sufficiently leading to action.</p>
<p>What matters now, however, is decisive action. All elements to hand, there is no need to wait for a governance lead. With many mixed messages, political stasis or climate neglecting policies across too many countries, it is up to corporate decision makers to say ‘enough’ and to take control over the pace of industrial sectors progress harnessing its energy productivity potentials – this is, at least for now, the economic ones of course! Those that promise increased productivity and competitiveness.</p>

<p>Creating an ‘understanding’ and adjusting programmes, approaches and mechanisms to this new understanding does not require much – but without this one thing, any attempt to understand will be doomed: asking questions!</p>
<p>Most statistics look in the past – what matters, however, is how to navigate the future, what path to choose, what decisions to take?</p>
<p>The energy efficiency index of the German industry (EEI) has been close to the manufacturing industry’s pulse for the past six years now, asking entrepreneurs what their opinion, their ambition and their past and present action is to topics around energy.</p>
<p>Reaching from <strong>technical issues</strong> (e.g the performance of implemented measures and the storage of energy consumption data) over <strong>financing topics</strong> (e.g. financing methods known and chosen or investment criteria) to views on more <strong>strategic topics</strong> (e.g. the feasibility to flexibilise energy demand) and <strong>general policy</strong> (e.g. are current support vehicles fit for purpose or what should be done to close the climate gap?), the Energy Efficiency Index is twice a year gathering the voice of approx. 1,000 companies across 27 manufacturing sectors. Gaining these insights must not be limited to companies operating in Germany!</p>
<p>This is why EEPs’ team is working hard with a network of partners to give companies across the world the chance to have a say, to share their view, to have a say by sharing their views on the <strong>“Energy Efficiency Barometer of Industry”, #EEBarometer </strong></p>
<p>As of now, companies in 88 countries already have the chance to state their point in their mother tongue – one of the twelve languagesfeatured by the #EEBarometer.</p>

<p>Yet another talking shop? No! For both, the UNECE Task Force and the UNIDO working group, the <strong>objective</strong> is to dramatically improve implementation of energy efficiency measures. We already have a huge array of resources to help achieve the low cost potential available to us. We just do not know where they are or who to talk to.</p>
<p>What is the <strong>solution</strong>? Two parallel UN projects, one to focus on getting a clear overview of all available industrial energy efficiency resources, the other to bring companies together to learn about these resources as well as how low cost industrial energy efficiency really is.</p>
<p>What will be the <strong>output</strong>? Increased use of industrial energy efficiency resources, improvement of resources themselves, awareness of the business case for industrial energy efficiency and connecting more with the supply chain companies -&gt; leading to: more and quicker implementation</p>
<p><strong>What is in it for companies</strong>? Policy is not adapted to business reality. Both UN projects want to specifically address this. They want <strong>industry to have a stronger voice</strong> in the development of policy and programs. The 2 projects&nbsp; also want to help industry <strong>understand better the overall benefits</strong> of industrial energy efficiency, and therefore the general approach is: <strong>How to ensure industrial energy efficiency policy drives overall productivity and competitiveness in parallel to energy efficiency gains? </strong>Here, the focus is developing business case for energy efficiency, and how non-energy benefits play a big role.</p>
<p><strong>What is in it for NGOs, initiatives</strong>, etc? The UN projects can bring them clients. They want companies to sign up to their programs and the projects can bring them companies who are open to their programs, respectively appear to be a good mutual fit to them. By bringing clarity to the industrial energy efficiency resources “chaos”, we generate business for them. Everyone is a winner, initiatives get members, the companies get support and energy gets saved.</p>

1215,"Making an impact",NULL,NULL,"<p>‘Every investment is an impact investment’<br /> Amy Clarke, Tribe Impact Capital&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Impact Investment &amp; SDGs</h3>
<p>I have been thinking a lot about impact investing since speaking at the King’s Impact Investing Society conference at the end of January.&nbsp; There still seems to be a lot of debate about definitions but it seems clear that impact investing is any investment which is aimed at achieving a positive impact on some societal problem as well as a financial return, personally I think of it as investing to have a positive impact on sustainability.&nbsp; Then the question of how to benchmark and measure that impact arises. <strong>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a good roadmap</strong> to all the areas where we need to improve sustainability – across environmental, social and economic spheres – and can form the basis of measurement. Impact investing aims to have a positive impact on key sustainability problems as well as make a return, it is not philanthropy.&nbsp; At the King’s conference Amy Clarke, the founder of Tribe said, “every investment is an impact investment” and that is correct – every investment has multiple impacts in the areas covered by the SDGs, some good, some bad, some intentional and some unintended. Impact investing is about focusing on making a positive impact as well as a financial return.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The question</h3>
<p>The question, that for so long has not been asked, and which impact investors ask, is what is the impact of this investment on the non-financial factors such as the environment, gender inequality, access to basic services or whatever areas the investment affects. <strong>Taking a systems view, we need to ask what is the totality of all the impacts of the investment?</strong> An impact investment should be positive in its impact on at least some of these factors. Important questions include; what is the base line for comparison, what are the targets and how do we measure progress?&nbsp; The SDGs are a set of global targets covering all aspects, economic, environmental and social and provide an overall context.&nbsp; Various initiatives to define and measure impacts now exist and are beginning to be applied more often. The&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.bridgesfundmanagement.com/a-new-global-standard-for-impact-management-and-measurement/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens external link in new window""><strong>Impact Management Project</strong></a>, which grew out of a project by Bridges Fund Management is one emerging global impact measurement tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course financial investors are not the only decision makers who have impact. Managers of organisations make decisions every day, small and large that have multi-dimensional impacts – whether they be decisions on which mode of travel to take or decisions to build a new factory or develop a new product.&nbsp; A systems based approach to investment appraisal should cover the <strong>non-financial impacts</strong>, both good and bad.&nbsp; To what extent and how do organisations that have environmental goals factor this into every decision?&nbsp; Appraisal of capital investment and the way it is taught and practiced is almost entirely focused on the financial aspect and yet we know that other non-financial factors can be more strategic and therefore important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumers make purchase decisions every-day that have impacts – often impacts in distant and remote parts of the world in some part of the long supply chains, impacts that can be negative in various aspects when viewed against the lens of the SDGs. Systems that bring greater transparency of the impacts to consumers have emerged but we need a lot more of them such that consumers can factor them into their decisions.&nbsp; How can we measure and communicate the wider impact of relatively small purchase decisions to consumers?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Impact investing is growing in volume</strong> and this is a really positive trend but we also need to think about, and talk about impact managing and impact consuming.&nbsp; Every investment decision, every management decision and every purchase decision has multiple impacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EnergyPro works to identify, develop and implement impact investment opportunities, particularly in support of the energy transition but also in other dimensions of sustainability.&nbsp; We also work with organisations to help them make more impactful decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we can help you in these areas let us know.</p>

<p>During last years, ICP Europe together with<strong> energy efficiency experts in Europe and US, and backed by a 1.5 billion EUR investor network</strong>, has developed the&nbsp;<strong>ICP framework</strong>, which assembles best practices and existing technical standards into a set of <strong>Protocols</strong>&nbsp;that define a clear roadmap for developing projects, determining saving estimates, and documenting and verifying results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the last 12 months, ICP has trained more than 450 Project Developers and Quality Assurance Assessors across Europe on its latest Protocols for <strong>Street Lighting</strong> and <strong>Industry &amp; Energy Supply</strong>. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>OK, really good news – so where is the catch?</h3>
<p>English</p>
<p>Yes, it is the language barrier. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To get an energy efficiency project certified (remember – trust, bankability), the ICP protocols must be used in the project development and documentation. And besides the common wisdom of “all people speak English”, when it comes to the nitty gritty stuff of a project, most people prefer their mother tongue. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>But…</h3>

<p>We knew that :-)</p>
<p>From the very beginning, we have used so called “In-Country-Advocates” who could explain the ICP concept and methodology in the respective languages. And we have worked on translations. However, to really go beyond the countries we could cover directly (<strong>Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Portugal, UK</strong>) we needed the help of partners. This is why ICP is working in strategic partnership with organisations in more countries, for the moment namely <strong>Spain, Greece</strong> and <strong>Italy</strong>.</p>
<p>In <strong>Italy</strong>, ICP is working with The Italian Federation for Energy Efficiency (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://eeperformance.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5d81a9b26c929499295465c91&amp;id=4bdb9b532e&amp;e=3ab18bafc9"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">FIRE</a>) whose purpose is to promote the rational use of energy in Italy. The partnership between the two entities has resulted in the translation of the ICP Industry &amp; Energy Supply and Street Lighting Protocols in Italian, the in-person training of more than 100 Project Developers and Quality Assurance Assessors and the use of ICP Street Lighting Protocol in one project so far.</p>
<p>In <strong>Greece</strong>, ICP has been working with the Institute of Zero Energy Building (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""http://inzeb.org/?lang=en"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">INZEB</a>) since 2016. More than 60 professionals were trained on the ICP Protocols, INZEB translated the Protocols and is now supporting the development of an ICP Street Lighting project.</p>
<p>In <strong>Spain</strong>, ICP has a partnership with the biggest national association of ESCO companies (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.anese.es/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">ANESE</a>), in order to promote the IREE<sup>TM</sup> certification scheme among Spanish ESCOs.</p>
<p>The availability of the <strong>ICP Protocols now in six languages, namely English, Bulgarian, German, Portuguese, Greek and Italian</strong>,&nbsp;will spur even more demand for the use of the Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ Certification scheme across Europe.

1217,"What the energy efficiency community can learn from the Club of Rome",NULL,NULL,"<h3>One step at a time</h3>
<p>We are confronting a lot of doom and gloom. On the one hand, we have the student climate activists and the Extinction Rebellion shaking our complacency to show that globally we are in a terrible state because of the devastating impact of climate change. On the other hand, we have too much complacency and inertia, for a large range of reasons from climate deniers to foot draggers.</p>
<p>The energy efficiency community has tended to follow the no-regrets road. There are so many good reasons to improve our energy performance in all aspects of our society that, for whatever reason, just do it. But improving our efficiency does not necessarily lead to lowering energy demand or reducing GHG emissions. Fortunately, eceee has been focusing on sufficiency and we are making some inroads there, even though our analytical base is still not complete.</p>
<p>After the first oil crisis, energy efficiency became a policy option for governments and societies. The International Energy Agency included it in its long-term policies. You can have people turn down their thermostat during an emergency. You cannot renovate all buildings when there is an oil crisis, at least not in the time frame of such a crisis.</p>
<p>Are we now in a climate crisis? It is probably even bigger when we include all the resources we are using up. I am reminded of a book last year from the Club of Rome written by Ernst von Weizsäcker and Anders Wijkman entitled&nbsp;<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://www.clubofrome.org/report/come-on/"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">Come On! Capitalism, short-termism, population and the destruction of the planet</a>. In the preface they write:</p>
<p>“The world is again in a critical situation. We see the need for a bold new beginning. This time, however, we believe it is particularly important to look at the philosophical roots of the current state of the world. We must question the legitimacy of the ethos of materialistic selfishness that is currently the most powerful driving force in the world, and we welcome Pope Francis’s initiative in addressing a deeper lying crisis of values, a central issue which the Club of Rome identified many years ago. The time has come, we believe, for a new Enlightenment or for otherwise overturning current habits of thought and action that only consider the short term.”</p>
<p>The authors argue that the human footprint is increasing fast and, if not reversed, will eventually lead to a collapse of the global economy. In their view, profit maximisation – under the principle of shareholder value first – and saving the planet are inherently in conflict and there needs to be a vastly improved balance between humans and nature, markets and the law, private consumption and public goods, short-term and long-term thinking, and between social justice and incentives for excellence. They propose an overhaul in the way that governments, businesses, financial systems, innovators and families interact with our planet.</p>
<p>The authors know how to shake us to our very roots, while being so non-confrontational and being so positive for the way forward. Yes, we need to re-think the policy framework. Yes, we need a new philosophy. Yes, we need to look at how the banking system works. And importantly, we need to base our new philosophy on balance – not the distortions we are faced with now in a myriad of inequalities.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the book offers many positive, practical examples, success stories and opportunities. Many areas of action concern policies at EU level and are of direct relevance to the current policy debate, for example, a move towards a circular economy can help overcome mineral scarcity, significantly lower carbon emissions and increase the number of jobs or regenerative agriculture can stop soil erosion, enhance yields and build carbon in the soil.</p>
<p>For us in the energy efficiency community, we have to take the positive, practical route. We know no other. Yes, we must quicken our step. Yes, we must gather more and more to take the same path. No, we must not panic. This has to be a planned, deliberate way forward.</p>

1218,"Sustainable finance: Simplicity liberates action!",NULL,NULL,"<p>For nearly ten years Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes (EEIP) has been working on the policies and tools enabling financing of energy efficiency in industry. &nbsp;Complexity of investing in energy efficiency ranges from the lack of investments’ asset class; size and scope of projects; to risk management and mitigation. &nbsp;Most recent taxonomy initiative from the EU, maps and consolidates many of these challenges and positions energy efficiency financing as one of the foundations of sustainable financing in the European Union.</p>
<p><strong>Taxonomy Expert Group (TEG)</strong> identified 67 activities for sustainable finance and emphasised the urgencies for investments that need speedy energy transition, like cement and steel. Both direct investments into energy efficiency projects and support initiatives such as investments in renewable electricity grids that can drive electrification of energy intensive industrial process (i.e. furnaces or smelters).</p>
<p>Furthermore, taxonomy work importantly encapsulates ‘system thinking’ into acceleration of energy transition. Connecting renewables, innovation in environmental technologies, financing tools and mechanisms, societal and consumer perspectives, has for long been perspective of EEIP. Energy efficiency in one sector does not work in isolation.</p>
<p>Although the taxonomy initiative might appear as complex to those out of financing sectors, the key objective is categorisation and simplification of financing and investment channels. We were present at the EU stakeholder dialogue of on the 24th of June on the guidelines on corporate climate-related information reporting as a part of Sustainable Finance Action Plan (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/180308-action-plan-sustainable-growth_en"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/180308-action-plan-sustainable-growth_en</a>). Sean Kidney, who lead TEG work, was unambiguous, “<em>simplicity liberates action</em>.” Developing a solid investment policy framework and clear guidelines can only increase sustainable investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still there is a question of timing. There is a clear urgency in acting if we want to mitigate climate change. &nbsp;Nancy Saich noted “<em>energy transition must be ambitions and fast. It has to happen within the next 10 years... or Europe will transit into not winning economic position</em>."" She added that ‘“ <em>investment in industry need to be a part of long term decarbonisation plan. Preferable to self standing measures and actions</em>.”</p>
<p>It is encouraging that sustainable finance is coming at the heart of decarbonisation and circular economy policies. Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President responsible for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union, said: “<em>The climate emergency leaves us with no choice but transit to a climate-neutral economy model. Today's new guidelines will help companies to disclose the impact of the climate change on their business as well as the impact of their activities on climate and therefore enable investors make more informed investment decisions.</em>”</p>
<h3>Three reports</h3>
<p>Most practically, the guidelines were supported by the publication of three TEG reports, including key recommendations on the types of economic activities that can make a real contribution to climate change mitigation or adaptation (taxonomy).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is &nbsp;a classification system – or taxonomy – for environmentally-sustainable economic activities (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/190618-sustainable-finance-teg-report-taxonomy_en"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/190618-sustainable-finance-teg-report-taxonomy_en</a>) . This is a key guideline providing practical tools for investors, industry and policymakers on the best ways to support and invest in economic activities that contribute to achieving a climate neutral economy in the European Union. It includes focus on the activities across a wide range of sectors, including energy, transport, buildings, manufacturing and ICT. It has identified low-carbon activities like zero-emissions transport but also transition activities like manufacturing of iron and steel in order to compile the most comprehensive classification system for sustainable activities to date.</p>
<p>The second expert report on an EU Green Bond Standard (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/190618-sustainable-finance-teg-report-green-bond-standard_en"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/190618-sustainable-finance-teg-report-green-bond-standard_en</a>) recommends clear and comparable criteria for issuing green bonds linking it to taxonomy. It determines which climate and environmentally-friendly activities should be eligible for funding via an EU green bond. The EU Commission expects this to boost the green bond market allowing investors to scale up sustainable and green investments.</p>
<p>Finally, a third expert report on EU climate benchmarks (<a class=""external-link-new-window"" data-htmlarea-external=""1"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/190618-sustainable-finance-teg-report-climate-benchmarks-and-disclosures_en"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens internal link in current window"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/190618-sustainable-finance-teg-report-climate-benchmarks-and-disclosures_en</a>) sets out the methodology and minimum technical requirements to enable investors to adopt a climate-conscious investment strategy, and address the risk of greenwashing. The report also sets out disclosure requirements by benchmark providers in relation to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and their alignment with the Paris agreement.</p>
<p>In addition, the EU budget increasingly becomes a driver of climate mainstreaming. To implement the Paris Agreement and the commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the EU Commission has proposed to raise the level of ambition for climate mainstreaming across all EU programmes, with a target of at least 25% of EU expenditure contributing to climate objectives between 2017-2021.</p>
<p><strong>Time to act!</strong> The process is not concluded and it is time for you to act and support. In the coming weeks, the TEG will conduct a call for feedback on the EU Taxonomy report and on the interim Climate benchmarks report. Register for EEIP newsletter to receive updates.</p>

1219,"Hungary, Portugal and Poland sign up to EU quantum communication infrastructure initiative",NULL,NULL,"<p>At the Digital Assembly, 7 Member States agreed to work together to explore how to make available a quantum communication infrastructure (QCI) in Europe, to boost European capabilities in quantum technologies, cybersecurity and industrial competitiveness.</p>
<p>The QCI will help Europe to secure its critical infrastructure and encryption systems against cyber threats, protecting smart energy grids, air traffic control, banks, healthcare facilities and more from hacking. It will also enable data centres to store and exchange information safely, and will preserve the long-term privacy of government data. The long-term plan is for the QCI infrastructure to become the backbone for Europe’s Quantum Internet, connecting quantum computers, simulators and sensors via quantum networks to distribute information and resources securely all over Europe.</p>
<p>The first service to make use of this new infrastructure will be&nbsp;<a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/glossary/quantum-key-distribution-qkd"">Quantum Key Distribution</a>&nbsp;(QKD). QKD is an extremely secure form of encryption: it uses the principles of quantum mechanics to provide the sender and recipient of an encrypted message with an intrinsically secure random key in such a way that an attacker cannot eavesdrop or control the system. QKD can secure confidential data, power grids, government communications and digital transactions, even against crypto code-breaking by the quantum computers of the future.</p>
<p>Andrus Ansip, European Commission Vice-President for the Digital Single Market, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>All sectors of our economy and society have the potential to benefit from deploying a quantum secure communication infrastructure all over the EU. This infrastructure will be able to secure financial transactions, keep the transmission, protection and long-term storage of sensitive data safe, and ensure the sovereignty of sensitive governmental information. In a world where securing our information online is of the utmost importance, Europe cannot afford to lag behind.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, Mariya Gabriel, added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In the years to come, the way we encrypt and secure our digital systems risks becoming vulnerable to ever more powerful computers, including quantum computers. To pre-empt this, and to protect our economy and society against cyber-threats, we need to work together at European level to keep our systems secure even as computers get faster. Therefore I am happy to see that today 7 EU countries have signed a declaration regarding the creation of a future quantum communications infrastructure. I am confident that other Member States will join this initiative, which has the potential to become the EU's next major success story.</em></p>
