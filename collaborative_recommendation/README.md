# NOTE:
   
This project is a part POC that was designed for enterprise level use by EEIP, Brussels. Hence files containing sensitive data cannot be released publicly.

This is why the data files expected in these locations have been omitted since they contain user specific interaction data. This said data is a property of [Energypages Sprl](https://ee-ip.org/about).   

Hence my apologies for not being able to provide the requried files to run this code. However the ipynb notebook contains screenshots of the data that might be useful for reference.   

The report has been added in the main page for further reference and observations.
